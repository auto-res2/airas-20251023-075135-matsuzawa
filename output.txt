In the original BOIL framework this compression ignores wall-clock cost, so runs that attain identical accuracy receive identical utility even when one is an order of magnitude slower \\cite{nguyen-2019-bayesian}. That bias wastes compute under fixed time budgets. We introduce BOIL-C, a one-line modification that subtracts a logarithmic penalty from the BOIL score: \\(u(x,t) = s\\big(r(x,t); m_0, g_0\\big) - \\beta\\cdot \\log\\big(1 + C(x,t)\\big)\\), where \\(s(\\cdot)\\) is BOIL's sigmoid score, \\(C(x,t)\\) the cumulative observed training cost, and \\(\\beta\\) a small weight. The surrogate, acquisition function and optimisation loop remain untouched, so BOIL-C is a drop-in change that favours hyper-parameters which reach good accuracy quickly. On CIFAR-10 with a 1.2 M-parameter CNN and on CartPole-v0 with DQN we compare BOIL-C to BOIL and (for RL) to Hyperband. With an 8 GPU-hour budget and five seeds BOIL-C matches or slightly improves final accuracy yet raises the area-under-best-so-far-versus-time by \\(\\approx 25\\%\\) on CIFAR-10, cuts median time-to-90\\% accuracy by 31\\%, and reaches the RL success threshold with 28\\% fewer interaction steps than BOIL, on par with Hyperband while evaluating fewer configurations. An ablation over \\(\\beta\\) reveals a broad, easy-to-tune regime. These findings show that a principled, cost-aware scalar yields meaningful time savings without sacrificing model quality.  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ^\nWarning 24 in paper.tex line 54: Delete this space to maintain correct pagereferences.\n\\label{sec:intro}  \n^\nWarning 2 in paper.tex line 55: Non-breaking space (`~') should have been used.\nHyper-parameter optimisation (HPO) for deep learning remains expensive because each evaluation entails running an iterative algorithm-such as SGD or Q-learning-to near convergence. Bayesian optimisation (BO) techniques that exploit partial learning curves relieve this burden by extracting signal early and steering the search accordingly. BOIL compresses every curve prefix into a single scalar reflecting performance and stability, feeds those scalars to a Gaussian-process surrogate, and selects the next configuration via an acquisition function \\cite{nguyen-2019-bayesian}.  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ^\nWarning 13 in paper.tex line 63: Intersentence spacing (`\\@') should perhaps be used.\nWe evaluate BOIL-C on two contrasting domains: image classification on CIFAR-10 with a modest CNN and reinforcement learning on CartPole-v0 with DQN.

In the original BOIL framework this compression ignores wall-clock cost, so runs that attain identical accuracy receive identical utility even when one is an order of magnitude slower \\cite{nguyen-2019-bayesian}. That bias wastes compute under fixed time budgets. We introduce BOIL-C, a one-line modification that subtracts a logarithmic penalty from the BOIL score: \\(u(x,t) = s\\big(r(x,t); m_0, g_0\\big) - \\beta\\cdot \\log\\big(1 + C(x,t)\\big)\\), where \\(s(\\cdot)\\) is BOIL's sigmoid score, \\(C(x,t)\\) the cumulative observed training cost, and \\(\\beta\\) a small weight. The surrogate, acquisition function and optimisation loop remain untouched, so BOIL-C is a drop-in change that favours hyper-parameters which reach good accuracy quickly. On CIFAR-10 with a 1.2 M-parameter CNN and on CartPole-v0 with DQN we compare BOIL-C to BOIL and (for RL) to Hyperband. With an 8 GPU-hour budget and five seeds BOIL-C matches or slightly improves final accuracy yet raises the area-under-best-so-far-versus-time by \\(\\approx 25\\%\\) on CIFAR-10, cuts median time-to-90\\% accuracy by 31\\%, and reaches the RL success threshold with 28\\% fewer interaction steps than BOIL, on par with Hyperband while evaluating fewer configurations. An ablation over \\(\\beta\\) reveals a broad, easy-to-tune regime. These findings show that a principled, cost-aware scalar yields meaningful time savings without sacrificing model quality.\n    51→\\end{abstract}\n    52→\n    53→\\section{Introduction}\n    54→\\label{sec:intro}\n    55→Hyper-parameter optimisation (HPO) for deep learning remains expensive because each evaluation entails running an iterative algorithm-such as SGD or Q-learning-to near convergence. Bayesian optimisation (BO) techniques that exploit partial learning curves relieve this burden by extracting signal early and steering the search accordingly. BOIL compresses every curve prefix into a single scalar reflecting performance and stability, feeds those scalars to a Gaussian-process surrogate, and selects the next configuration via an acquisition function \\cite{nguyen-2019-bayesian}.\n    56→\n    57→A blind spot of BOIL is cost agnosticism: two runs that ultimately reach the same accuracy receive the same utility regardless of how long they took. In practice this biases BO toward slow but eventually strong configurations, delaying progress under wall-clock constraints. We therefore ask: can BOIL's compression be made cost-aware with minimal disruption to the rest of the pipeline?\n    58→\n    59→The challenge is twofold. First, any penalty must be generic-applicable across tasks and metrics-and must preserve the desirable monotonicity of BOIL's score with respect to performance. Second, the modification should neither destabilise the surrogate nor require re-engineering downstream components.\n    60→\n    61→We propose BOIL-C, which augments BOIL's score with a logarithmic cost penalty. For configuration \\(x\\) after \\(t\\) steps we define \\(u(x,t) = s\\big(r(x,t); m_0, g_0\\big) - \\beta\\cdot \\log\\big(1 + C(x,t)\\big)\\), where \\(C(x,t)\\) is cumulative wall-clock seconds and \\(\\beta\\) controls the trade-off. The log ensures diminishing penalties, encouraging rapid progress early without discarding promising but slower curves. Setting \\(\\beta=0\\) recovers BOIL exactly, hence BOIL-C is a strict generalisation.\n    62→\n    63→We evaluate BOIL-C on two contrasting domains: image classification on CIFAR-10 with a modest CNN and reinforcement learning on CartPole-v0 with DQN. All methods-BOIL-C, BOIL and (for RL) Hyperband-receive identical 8 GPU-hour budgets and are run with five independent seeds. Efficiency is measured by integrating the best-so-far validation metric over wall-clock time (AUC-Time). BOIL-C preserves or slightly betters final performance while substantially improving AUC-Time and reducing time-to-threshold.\n    64→\n    65→\\subsection{Contributions}\n    66→\\begin{itemize}\n    67→  \\item \\textbf{One-line cost-aware compression}: A cost-aware learning-curve compression that adds a single logarithmic term to BOIL's scalar, requiring only one line of code.\n    68→  \\item \\textbf{Theory and \\(\\beta\\) guidance}: A theoretical justification and practical guidance for choosing \\(\\beta\\).\n    69→  \\item \\textbf{Empirical speedups}: Comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CartPole-v0 showing \\(\\approx\\)25-30\\% faster time-to-result without loss of accuracy or return.\n    70→  \\item \\textbf{Positioning among cost-aware HPO}: A discussion placing BOIL-C among cost-aware HPO strategies and contrasting it with partition-based objectives \\cite{mlodozeniec-2023-hyperparameter}.\n    71→\\end{itemize}\n    72→\n    73→Future work includes adaptive \\(\\beta\\) schedules, integration with multi-fidelity schedulers and evaluation on larger-scale tasks.\n    74→\n    75→\\section{Related Work}\n    76→\\label{sec:related}\n    77→\\subsection{Bayesian Optimisation with Partial Learning Curves}\n    78→BOIL is a seminal example of using partial curves within BO \\cite{nguyen-2019-bayesian}. Follow-up work has explored hierarchical surrogates and curve extrapolation yet still compresses curves independently of cost. BOIL-C differs by embedding cost directly in the scalar target, leaving the surrogate unchanged.\n    79→\n    80→\\subsection{Cost-Aware Resource Schedulers}\n    81→Hyperband and successive-halving allocate resources adaptively based on intermediate results, implicitly trading accuracy against compute. Those methods act at the scheduler level, whereas BOIL-C embeds cost inside the surrogate target, making it orthogonal and in principle combinable with schedulers.\n    82→\n    83→\\subsection{Alternative Objectives Beyond Validation-Set BO}\n    84→Neural network partitioning optimises hyper-parameters via an out-of-sample loss computed from parameter/data shards, bypassing validation data entirely \\cite{mlodozeniec-2023-hyperparameter}. While elegant, that objective assumes a single training run and different statistical properties; it is therefore not directly comparable to BO's iterative evaluation paradigm adopted here.\n    85→\n    86→\\section{Background}\n    87→\\label{sec:background}\n    88→\\subsection{Problem Setting}\n    89→Let \\(x\\) denote a hyper-parameter configuration and \\(r(x,t)\\) the validation metric after \\(t\\) training steps (epochs for supervised learning, environment interactions for RL). Each step incurs cost \\(c(x,t)\\) seconds, and cumulative cost is \\(C(x,t) = \\sum_{i \\le t} c(x,i)\\). We wish to maximise \\(r\\) subject to a fixed wall-clock budget.\n    90→\n    91→\\subsection{BOIL's Compression}\n    92→BOIL maps each partial curve to \\(s\\big(r(x,t); m_0, g_0\\big) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\big(- (r - m_0)/g_0\\big)}\\), where \\(m_0\\) and \\(g_0\\) are learnt hyper-parameters, and feeds that scalar to a Gaussian-process surrogate. The acquisition function (expected improvement, EI) balances exploration and exploitation when proposing either to extend an existing run or start a new one.\n    93→\n    94→\\subsection{Limitation: Cost Agnosticism}\n    95→Because \\(s\\) depends only on \\(r\\), the surrogate undervalues fast learners and overvalues slow ones that will eventually perform well, delaying progress when the budget is tight. Addressing this deficiency motivates BOIL-C.\n    96→\n    97→\\section{Method}\n    98→\\label{sec:method}\n    99→\\subsection{Cost-Aware Utility}\n   100→BOIL-C defines the utility\n   101→\\[\n   102→  u(x,t) = s\\big(r(x,t); m_0, g_0\\big) - \\beta\\cdot \\log\\big(1 + C(x,t)\\big).\n   103→\\]\n   104→The logarithm ensures \\(u\\) remains bounded and yields diminishing penalties: a second of cost early is penalised more than a second late. \\(\\beta\\) may be fixed (0.25 in our experiments) or optimised jointly with \\(m_0, g_0\\) by marginal likelihood.\n   105→\n   106→\\subsection{Integration into the BOIL Pipeline}\n   107→Only the utility computation changes; all subsequent steps-GP update, EI maximisation, and decision to continue or start runs-remain identical.

Thus \\(\\beta=0.1\\)-0.3 is a robust operating range.\n   182→\n   183→\\subsection{Fairness and Limitations}\n   184→All runs used identical budgets, seeds, search spaces and training pipelines. Surrogate hyper-parameters (kernel, noise) and acquisition (EI) were shared. The sole difference between BOIL and BOIL-C is the cost-aware scalar.\n   185→\n   186→BOIL-C presumes reasonably stable timing; heterogeneous or cloud settings may require normalisation. Extremely large \\(\\beta\\) can over-penalise compute-heavy but ultimately superior configurations.\n   187→\n   188→\\section{Conclusion}\n   189→\\label{sec:conclusion}\n   190→BOIL-C demonstrates that incorporating compute cost directly into learning-curve compression is a powerful yet simple means to accelerate Bayesian hyper-parameter optimisation. A single logarithmic penalty term steers BO toward configurations that learn quickly, yielding \\(\\approx\\)25-30\\% faster time-to-result on both supervised and reinforcement-learning benchmarks while matching or slightly improving final performance. Because the surrogate, acquisition and scheduler remain untouched, BOIL-C can be adopted in existing BOIL pipelines with minimal effort. Future directions include adaptive \\(\\beta\\) schedules, integration with asynchronous multi-fidelity frameworks and evaluation on larger-scale tasks such as ImageNet or continuous-control RL environments.

Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of the edited file:\n    49→\\begin{abstract}\n    50→Bayesian optimisation for iterative learners commonly exploits partially observed learning curves by compressing them into scalar utilities for a surrogate model. In the original BOIL framework this compression ignores wall-clock cost, so runs that attain identical accuracy receive identical utility even when one is an order of magnitude slower~\\cite{nguyen-2019-bayesian}. That bias wastes compute under fixed time budgets. We introduce BOIL-C, a one-line modification that subtracts a logarithmic penalty from the BOIL score: \\(u(x,t) = s\\big(r(x,t); m_0, g_0\\big) - \\beta\\cdot \\log\\big(1 + C(x,t)\\big)\\), where \\(s(\\cdot)\\) is BOIL's sigmoid score, \\(C(x,t)\\) the cumulative observed training cost, and \\(\\beta\\)~a small weight. The surrogate, acquisition function and optimisation loop remain untouched, so BOIL-C is a drop-in change that favours hyper-parameters which reach good accuracy quickly. On CIFAR-10 with a 1.2~M-parameter CNN and on CartPole-v0 with DQN we compare BOIL-C to BOIL and (for RL) to~Hyperband. With an 8~GPU-hour budget and five seeds BOIL-C matches or slightly improves final accuracy yet raises the area-under-best-so-far-versus-time by \\(\\approx 25\\%\\) on CIFAR-10, cuts median time-to-90\\% accuracy by 31\\%, and reaches the RL success threshold with 28\\% fewer interaction steps than BOIL, on par with Hyperband while evaluating fewer configurations. An ablation over \\(\\beta\\) reveals a broad, easy-to-tune regime. These findings show that a principled, cost-aware scalar yields meaningful time savings without sacrificing model quality.\n    51→\\end{abstract}\n    52→\n    53→\\section{Introduction}\n    54→\\label{sec:intro}%\n    55→%\n    56→Hyper-parameter optimisation (HPO) for deep learning remains expensive because each evaluation entails running an iterative algorithm---such as SGD or Q-learning---to near convergence.

In practice this biases BO toward slow but eventually strong configurations, delaying progress under wall-clock constraints. We therefore ask: can BOIL's compression be made cost-aware with minimal disruption to the rest of the pipeline?\n    59→\n    60→The challenge is twofold. First, any penalty must be generic-applicable across tasks and metrics-and must preserve the desirable monotonicity of BOIL's score with respect to performance. Second, the modification should neither destabilise the surrogate nor require re-engineering downstream components."}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b5752ab2-1b12-40f8-9c3e-751e91d22c09","uuid":"e506095c-f046-4712-b72e-46b30545f49b"}
