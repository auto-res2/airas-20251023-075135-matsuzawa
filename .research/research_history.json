Our algorithm outperforms all existing baselines in identifying optimal hyperparameters in minimal time. 1 Introduction Deep learning (DL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have led to impressive breakthroughs in a broad range of applications such as game play [26, 36], motor control [43], and image recognition [20]. To maintain general applicability, these algorithms expose sets of hyperparameters to adapt their behavior to any particular task at hand. This ﬂexibility comes at the price of having to tune an additional set of parameters – poor settings lead to drastic performance losses [11, 30, 37]. On top of being notoriously sensitive to these choices, deep (reinforcement) learning systems often have high training costs, in computational resources and time. For example, a single training run on the Atari Breakout game took approximately 75 hours on a GPU cluster [26]. Tuning DRL parameters is further complicated as only noisy evaluations of an agent’s ﬁnal performance are obtainable. Bayesian optimization (BO) [12, 28, 35] has recently achieved considerable success in optimizing these hyperparameters. This approach casts the tuning process as a global optimization problem based on noisy evaluations of a black-box function f . BO constructs a surrogate model typically using a Gaussian process (GP) [31], over this unknown function. This GP surrogate is used to build an acquisition function [13, 44] which suggests the next hyperparameter to evaluate. In modern machine learning (ML) algorithms [15], the training process is often conducted in an iterative manner. A natural example is given by deep learning where training is usually based on stochastic gradient descent and other iterative procedures. Similarly, the training of reinforcement learning agents is mostly carried out using multiple episodes. The knowledge accumulated during these training iterations can be useful to inform BO. However, most existing BO approaches [35] ∗These authors contributed equally. 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada. arXiv:1909.09593v5  [cs.LG]  16 Jan 2021deﬁne the objective function as the average performance over the ﬁnal training iterations. In doing so, they ignore the information contained in the preceding training steps. In this paper, we present a Bayesian optimization approach for tuning algorithms where iterative learning is available – the cases of deep learning and deep reinforcement learning. First, we consider the joint space of input hyperparameters and number of training iterations to capture the learning progress at different time steps in the training process. We then propose to transform the whole training curve into a numeric score according to user preference. To learn across the joint space efﬁciently, we introduce a data augmentation technique leveraging intermediate information from the iterative process. By exploiting the iterative structure of training procedures, we encourage our algorithm to consider running a larger number of cheap (but high-utility) experiments, when cost- ignorant algorithms would only be able to run a few expensive ones. We demonstrate the efﬁciency of our algorithm on training DRL agents on several well-known benchmarks as well as the training of convolutional neural networks. In particular, our algorithm outperforms existing baselines in ﬁnding the best hyperparameter in terms of wall-clock time. Our main contributions are: • an algorithm to optimize the learning curve of a ML algorithm by using training curve compression, instead of averaged ﬁnal performance; • an approach to learn the compression curve from the data and a data augmentation tech- nique for increased sample-efﬁciency; • demonstration on tuning DRL and convolutional neural networks. 2 Related Work in Iteration-Efﬁcient Bayesian Optimization The ﬁrst algorithm category employs stopping criteria to terminate some training runs early and allo- cate resources towards more promising settings. These criteria typically involve projecting towards a ﬁnal score from early training stages. Freeze-thaw BO [42] models the training loss over time us- ing a GP regressor under the assumption that the training loss roughly follows an exponential decay. Based on this projection, training resources are allocated to the most promising settings. Hyperband [8, 23] dynamically allocates computational resources (e.g. training epochs or dataset size) through random sampling and eliminates under-performing hyperparameter settings by successive halving. Attempts have also been made to improve the epoch efﬁciency of other hyperparameter optimization algorithms in [5, 7, 18] which predict the ﬁnal learning outcome based on partially trained learning curves to identify hyperparameter settings that are expected to under-perform and early-stop them. In the context of DRL, however, these stopping criteria, including the exponential decay assumed in Freeze-thaw BO [42], may not be applicable, due to the unpredictable ﬂuctuations of DRL reward curves. In the supplement, we illustrate the noisiness of DRL training. The second category [16, 17, 23, 41, 48] aims to reduce the resource consumption of BO by utilizing low-ﬁdelity functions which can be obtained by using a subset of the training data or by training the ML model for a small number of iterations. Multi-task BO [41] requires the user to deﬁne a division of the dataset into pre-deﬁned and discrete subtasks. Multi-ﬁdelity BO with continuous approximation (BOCA) [16] and hierarchical partition [34] extend this idea to continuous settings. Speciﬁcally, BOCA ﬁrst selects the hyperparameter input and then the corresponding ﬁdelity to be evaluated at. The ﬁdelity in this context refers to the use of different number of learning iterations. Analogous to BOCA’s consideration of continuous ﬁdelities, Fabolas [17] proposes to model the combined space of input hyperparameter and dataset size and then select the optimal input and dataset size jointly. The above approaches typically identify performance of hyperparameters via the average (either training or validation) loss of the last learning iterations. Thereby, they do not account for potential noise in the learning process (e.g., they might select unstable settings that jumped to high perfor- mance in the last couple of iterations). 3 Bayesian Optimization for Iterative Learning (BOIL) Problem setting. We consider training a machine learning algorithm given a d-dimensional hy- perparameter x ∈X ⊂Rd for t iterations.

Bottom: observations are selected to augment the dataset (red dots). The heatmap indicates the GP predictive mean µ for f across the number of episodest used to train an agent. Tmin and Tmax are two user-deﬁned thresholds for the number of training episodes. x is a hyperparameter to be tuned. Right: we learn the optimal parameter g∗ 0 and m∗ 0 for each experiment separately. training evaluations r(·| x,t) for t iterations, t ∈[Tmin,Tmax]. These could be episode rewards in DRL or training accuracies in DL. An important property of iterative training is that we know the whole curve at preceding steps r(t′|x,t), ∀t′≤t. Given the raw training curve r(·| x,t), we assume an underlying smoothed black-box function f , deﬁned in Sec. 3.2. Formally, we aim to ﬁnd x∗= argmaxx∈X f (x,Tmax); at the same time, we want to keep the overall training time, ∑N i=1 c(xi,ti), of evaluated settings [xi,ti] as low as possible. We summarize our variables in Table 1 in the supplement for ease of reading. 3.1 Selecting a next point using iteration-efﬁcient modeling We follow popular designs in [17, 19, 39, 41] and model the cost-sensitive black-box function as f (x,t) ∼GP(0,k([x,t],[x′,t′])), where k is an appropriate covariance functions and [x,t] ∈Rd+1. For simplicity and robustness, the cost function c(x,t) is approximated by a linear regressor. De- pending on the setting, it may be more appropriate to employ a second GP or different parametric model if the cost has a more complex dependence on hyperparameters x and iterations t. We regu- larly (re-)optimize both kernel and cost function parameters in between point acquisitions. More speciﬁcally, we choose the covariance function as a productk ([x,t],[x′,t′]) =k(x,x′)×k(t,t′) to induce joint similarities over parameter and iteration space. We estimate the predictive mean and uncertainty for a GP [31] at any input z∗= [x∗,t∗] as µ (z∗) =k∗ [ K +σ2 y I ]−1 y (1) σ2 (z∗) =k∗∗−k∗ [ K +σ2 y I ]−1 kT ∗ (2) where y = [yi]∀i, k∗= [k (z∗,zi)]∀i, K = [k (zi,zj)]∀i, j, k∗∗= k (z∗,z∗), and σ2 y is the noise variance of f . Cost predictions at any particular parameter x and time t are given by µc([x∗,t∗]) =βT [x,t], where β is directly computed from data {Z = [xi,ti],c = [ci]}∀i as β = (ZT Z)−1Zc [1]. Our goal is to select a point with high function value (exploitation), high uncertainty (exploration) and low cost (cheap). At each iteration n, we query the input parameter xn and the number of iteration tn [38, 48]: zn = [xn,tn] = argmax x∈X ,t∈[Tmin,Tmax] α(x,t)/µc(x,t). (3) 3Although our framework is available for any acquisition choices [13, 22, 47], to cope with output noise, we follow [45] and slight modify the expected improvement criterion using the maximum mean GP prediction µmax n . Let λ = µn(z)−µmaxn σn(z) , we then have a closed-form for the new expected improvement (EI) as αEI n (z) =σn (z)φ (λ) + [µn (z)−µmax n ]Φ(λ) where φ is the standard normal p.d.f., Φ is the c.d.f, µn and σn are the GP predictive mean and variance deﬁned in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), respectively. 3.2 Training curve compression and estimating the transformation function Existing BO approaches [4, 23] typically deﬁne the objective function as an average loss over the ﬁnal learning episodes. However, this does not take into consideration how stable performance is or the training stage at which it has been achieved. We argue that averaging learning losses is likely misleading due to the noise and ﬂuctuations of our observations (learning curves) – particularly during the early stages of training. We propose to compress the whole learning curve into a numeric score via a preference function representing the user’s desired training curve. In the following, we use the Sigmoid function (speciﬁcally the Logistic function) to compute the utility score as y = ˆy(r,m0,g0) =r(·|x,t)•l(·|m0,g0) = t ∑ u=1 r(u |x,t) 1 +exp(−g0 [u −m0]) (4) where •is a dot product, a Logistic function l(·| m0,g0) is parameterized by a growth parameter g0 deﬁning a slope and the middle point of the curve m0. The optimal parameters g0 and m0 are estimated directly from the data. We illustrate different shapes of l parameterized by g0 and m0 in the appendix. The Sigmoid preference has a number of desirable properties. As early weights are small, less credit is given to ﬂuctuations at the initial stages, making it less likely for our surrogate to be biased towards randomly well performing settings. However, as weights monotonically increase, hyperparameters with improving performance are preferred. As weights saturate over time, stable, high performing conﬁgurations are preferred over short “performance spikes” characteristic of un- stable training. Lastly, this utility score assigns higher values to the same performance if it is being maintained over more episodes. Learning the transformation function from data. Different compression curves l(), parameter- ized by different choices of g0 and m0 in Eq. (4), may lead to different utilities y and thus affect the performance. The optimal values of g∗ 0 and m∗ 0 are unknown in advance. Therefore, we propose to learn these values g∗ 0 and m∗ 0 directly from the data. Our intuition is that the ‘optimal’ compression curve l(m∗ 0,g∗ 0) will lead to a better ﬁt of the GP. This better GP surrogate model, thus, will result in better prediction as well as optimization performance. We parameterize the GP log marginal likelihood L [31] as the function of m0 and g0: L(m0,g0) =1 2 ˆyT ( K +σ2 y I )−1 ˆy −1 2 ln ⏐⏐K +σ2 y I ⏐⏐ +const (5) where σ2 y is the output noise variance, ˆy is the function of m0 and g0 deﬁned in Eq. (4). We optimize m0 and g0 (jointly with other GP hyperparameters) using multi-start gradient descent. We derive the derivative ∂L ∂m0 = ∂L ∂ ˆy ∂ ˆy ∂m0 and ∂L ∂g0 = ∂L ∂ ˆy ∂ ˆy ∂g0 which can be computed analytically as: ∂L ∂ ˆy = ( K +σ2 y IN )−1 ˆy; ∂ ˆy ∂m0 = −g0 ×exp(−g0 [u −m0]) [1 +exp(−g0 [u −m0])]2 ; ∂ ˆy ∂g0 = −m0 ×exp(−g0 [u −m0]) [1 +exp(−g0 [u −m0])]2 . The estimated compression curves are illustrated in Right Fig. 1 and in Sec. 4.1. 3.3 Augmenting the training data When evaluating a parameter x over t iterations, we obtain not only a ﬁnal score but also all reward sequences r(t′|x,t),∀t′= 1,..., t. The auxiliary information from the curve can be useful for BO. Therefore, we propose to augment the information from the curve into the sample set of our GP model. A naïve approach for augmentation is to add a full curve of points {[x, j],yj}t j=1 where yj is computed using Eq. (4). However, this approach can be redundant and may im- pose serious issues in the conditioning of the GP covariance matrix.

Left: our augmentation. Right: using a full curve. If we add too many observations, the GP covariance matrix becomes ill-conditioned. On the right, the GP ﬁt is poor with a large mean estimate range of [−400,240] even though the output is standardized N (0,1). All x-axis are over x, a hyperparameter to be tuned. more evaluations closely, the conditioning of the GP covariance degrades further, as dis- cussed in [24]. This conditioning issue is especially serious in our noisy DRL settings. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Iterations 0 5 10 15 20 25Log of Condition Number Condition Number of GP Covariance Augmentation No Augmentation Full Curve Reasonable Threshold Figure 3: The condition number of GP covari- ance matrix deteriorates if we add the whole curve of points into a GP. The large condition number indicates the nearness to singularity. We highlight this effect on GP estimation in Fig. 2 wherein the GP mean varies erratically when the natural log of the condition number of the GP co- variance matrix goes above 25 (see Fig. 3) as we include the whole curve. Selecting subset of points from the curve. Dif- ferent solutions, such as the addition of artiﬁcial noise or altering the kernel’s length-scales, have been proposed. We decide to use an active learn- ing approach [10, 29] as sampled data points are expected to contain a lot of redundant informa- tion. As a consequence, the loss of information from sub-sampling the data should be minimal and information-eroding modiﬁcation of the ker- nel matrix itself can be avoided. As a side beneﬁt, the reduced number of sampled points speeds up inference in our GP models. In particular, we select samples at the maximum of the GP predictive uncertainty. Formally, we sequentially select a set Z = [z1,...zM], zm = [x,tm], by varying tm while keeping x ﬁxed as zm =argmax ∀t′≤t σ([x,t′] |D′),∀m ≤M s.t. lnof cond(K) ≤δ (6) where D′= D∪{zj = [x,tj]}m−1 j=1 . This sub-optimisation problem is done in a one-dimensional space of t′∈{Tmin,..., t}, thus it is cheap to optimize using (multi-start) gradient descent (the derivative of GP predictive variance is available [31]). Alternatively, a ﬁxed-size grid could be considered, but this could cause conditioning issues when a point in the grid [ x,tgrid ] is placed near another existing point [ x′,tgrid ] , i.e., ||x −x′||2 ≤ε for some small ε. These generated points Z are used to calculate the output r(zm) and augmented into the observation set (X,Y ) for ﬁtting the GP. The number of samplesM is adaptively chosen such that the natural log of the condition number of the covariance matrix is less than a threshold. This is to ensure that the GP covariance matrix condition number behaves well by reducing the number of unnecessary points added to the GP at later stages. We compute the utility score ym given zm for each augmented point using Eq. (4). In addition, we can estimate the running time cm using the predictive mean µc(zm). We illustrate the augmented observations and estimated scores in Fig. 1. We summarize the overall algorithm in Alg. 1. To enforce non-negativity and numerical stability, we make use of the transformations α ←log[1 +exp(α)] and µc ←log[1 +exp(µc)]. 4 Experiments We assess our model by tuning hyperparameters for two DRL agents on three environments and a CNN on two datasets. We provide additional illustrations and experiments in the appendix. 5Algorithm 1 Bayesian Optimization with Iterative Learning (BOIL) Input: #iter N, initial data D0, z = [x,t].

All experimental results are averaged over 20 independent runs with differ- ent random seeds. Final performance is estimated by evaluating the chosen hyperparameter over the maximum number of iterations. All experiments are executed on a NVIDIA 1080 GTX GPU using the tensorﬂow-gpu Python package. The DRL environments are available through the OpenAI gym [3] and Mujoco [43]. Our DRL implementations are based on the open source from Open AI Baselines [6]. We release our implementation at https://github.com/ntienvu/BOIL. We use square-exponential kernels for the GP in our model and estimate their parameters by maxi- mizing the marginal likelihood [31]. We set the maximum number of augmented points to beM = 15 and a threshold for a natural log of GP condition numberδ = 20. We note that the optimization over- head is much less than the black-box function evaluation time. Baselines. We compare with Hyperband [23] which demonstrated empirical successes in tuning deep learning applications in an iteration-efﬁcient manner. We extend the discrete multi-task BO [41] to the continuous case – which can also be seen as continuous multi-ﬁdelity BO [16, 39] as in our setting, they both consider cost-sensitivity and iteration-efﬁciency. We, therefore, label the two baselines as continuous multi-task/ﬁdelity BO (CM-T/F-BO). We have ignored the minor difference in these settings, such as multi-task approaches jointly optimizes the ﬁdelity and input while BOCA [16] ﬁrst selects the input and then the ﬁdelity. Our focus is to demonstrate the effectiveness of optimizing the learning curve using compression and augmentation techniques. We therefore omit the comparison of various acquisition functions and kernel choices which can easily be used in our model. We also do not compare with Fabolas [17] which is designed to vary dataset sizes, not iteration numbers. We would expect the performance of Fabolas to be close to CM-T/F-BO. We are unable to compare with FreezeThaw as the code is not available. However, the curves in our setting are not exponential decays and thus ill-suited to their model (see last ﬁgure in the appendix). We have considered an ablation study in the appendix using a time kernel following the exponential decay proposed in Freeze-thaw method [42]. Task descriptions. We consider three DRL settings including a Dueling DQN (DDQN) [46] agent in the CartPole-v0 environment and Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) [25] agents in the InvertedPendulum-v2 and Reacher-v2 environments. In addition to the DRL applications, we tune 6 hyperparameters for training a convolutional neural network [21] on the SVHN dataset and CI- FAR10. Due to space considerations, we refer to the appendix for further details. 4.1 Model illustration /uni00000013/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000016/uni00000013/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000018/uni00000013/uni00000019/uni00000013 /uni00000025/uni00000032/uni00000003/uni0000002c/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051/uni00000056 /uni00000013 /uni00000018 /uni00000014/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000018/uni00000006/uni00000024/uni00000058/uni0000004a/uni00000050/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000047/uni00000003/uni00000032/uni00000045/uni00000056 /uni00000031/uni00000058/uni00000050/uni00000045/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000003/uni00000052/uni00000049/uni00000003/uni0000002a/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000047/uni00000003/uni00000024/uni00000058/uni0000004a/uni00000050/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000047/uni00000003/uni00000032/uni00000045/uni00000056 Figure 4: DDQN on CartPole. The number of augmented observations reduces over time. We ﬁrst illustrate the estimated compression func- tion l(m∗ 0,g∗ 0) in Right Fig. 1 from different experi- ments. These Logistic parameters g∗ 0 and m∗ 0 are es- timated by maximizing the GP marginal likelihood and used for compressing the curve. We show that the estimated curve from CartPole tends to reach the highest performance much earlier than Reacher because CartPole is somewhat easier to train than Reacher. We next examine the count of augmented observa- tions generated per iteration in Fig. 4. Although this number is ﬂuctuating, it tends to reduce over 6/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000016/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000018/uni00000013/uni00000013 /uni00000028/uni00000053/uni0000004c/uni00000056/uni00000052/uni00000047/uni00000048 /uni0000001a/uni00000013 /uni00000019/uni00000013 /uni00000018/uni00000013 /uni00000017/uni00000013 /uni00000016/uni00000013 /uni00000015/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000013 /uni00000024/uni00000059/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni0000004a/uni00000048/uni00000003/uni00000035/uni00000048/uni0000005a/uni00000044/uni00000055/uni00000047 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 /uni00000025/uni00000032 /uni00000025/uni00000032/uni00000010/uni0000002f /uni00000025/uni00000032/uni0000002c/uni0000002f /uni00000013/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000019/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni0000001b/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000014/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000014/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000013 /uni00000028/uni00000053/uni0000004c/uni00000056/uni00000052/uni00000047/uni00000048 /uni00000015/uni00000018 /uni00000018/uni00000013 /uni0000001a/uni00000018 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000015/uni00000018 /uni00000014/uni00000018/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni0000001a/uni00000018 /uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000024/uni00000059/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni0000004a/uni00000048/uni00000003/uni00000035/uni00000048/uni0000005a/uni00000044/uni00000055/uni00000047 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 /uni00000025/uni00000032 /uni00000025/uni00000032/uni00000010/uni0000002f /uni00000025/uni00000032/uni0000002c/uni0000002f Figure 5: The learning curves of the best found parameters by different approaches. The curves show that BO-L and BOIL reliably identify parameters leading to stable training. BOIL takes only half total time to ﬁnd this optimal curve. time. BOIL does not add more augmented observations at the later stage when we have gained sufﬁcient information and GP covariance conditioning falls below our threshold δ = 20. 4.2 Ablation study of curve compression To demonstrate the impact of our training curve compression, we compare BOIL to vanilla Bayesian optimization (BO) and with compression (BO-L) given the same number of iterations at Tmax. We show that using the curve compression leads to stable performance, as opposed to the existing tech- nique of averaging the last iterations. We plot the learning curves of the best hyperparameters identiﬁed by BO, BO-L and BOIL. Fig. 5 shows the learning progress over Tmax episodes for each of these. The curves are smoothed by averaging over 100 consecutive episodes for increased clarity. We ﬁrst note that all three algorithms eventually obtain similar performance at the end of learning. However, since BO-L and BOIL take into account the preceding learning steps, they achieve higher performance more quickly. Furthermore, they achieve this more reliably as evidenced by the smaller error bars (shaded regions). 4.3 Tuning deep reinforcement learning and CNN We now optimize hyperparameters for deep reinforcement learning algorithms; in fact, this applica- tion motivated the development of BOIL. The combinations of hyperparameters to be tuned, target DRL algorithm and environment can be found in the appendix. Comparisons by iterations and real-time. Fig. 6 illustrates the performance of different algo- rithms against the number of iterations as well as real-time (the plots for CIFAR10 are in the ap- pendix). The performance is the utility score of the best hyperparameters identiﬁed by the baselines. Across all three tasks, BOIL identiﬁes optimal hyperparameters using signiﬁcantly less computation time than other approaches. The plots show that other approaches such as BO and BO-L can identify well-performing hyperpa- rameters in fewer iterations than BOIL. However, they do so only considering costly, high-ﬁdelity evaluations resulting in signiﬁcantly higher evaluation times. In contrast to this behavior, BOIL ac- counts for the evaluation costs and chooses to initially evaluate low-ﬁdelity settings consuming less time. This allows fast assessments of a multitude of hyperparameters. The information gathered here is then used to inform later point acquisitions. Hereby, the inclusion of augmented observations is crucial in offering useful information readily available from the data. In addition, this augmenta- tion is essential to prevent from the GP kernel issue instead of adding the full curve of points into our GP model. Hyperband [23] exhibits similar behavior in that it uses low ﬁdelity (small t) evaluations to reduce a pool of randomly sampled conﬁgurations before evaluating at high ﬁdelity (large t). To deal with noisy evaluations and other effects, this process is repeated several times. This puts Hyperband at a disadvantage particularly in the noisy DRL tasks. Since early performance ﬂuctuates hugely, Hyperband can be misled in where to allocate evaluation effort. It is then incapable of revising 7/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000016/uni00000013/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000018/uni00000013/uni00000019/uni00000013

(Left) and real-time (Right). Given the same time bud- get, CM-T/F-BO, Hyperband and BOIL can take more evaluations than vanilla BO, BO-L and Rand. BOIL outperforms other competitors in ﬁnding the optimal parameters in an iteration-efﬁcient man- ner. CM-T/F-BO does not augment the observations from the curve and requires more evaluations. The results of InvertedPendulum and CNN-CIFAR10 are in the appendix. these choices until an entirely new pool of hyperparameters is sampled and evaluated from scratch. In contrast to this, BOIL is more ﬂexible than Hyperband in that it can freely explore-exploit the whole joint space. The GP surrogate hereby allows BOIL to generalize across hyperparameters and propagate information through the joint space. 5 Conclusion and Future work Our framework complements the existing BO toolbox for hyperparameter tuning with iterative learn- ing. We present a way of leveraging our understanding that later stages of the training process are informed by progress made in earlier ones. This results in a more iteration-efﬁcient hyperparame- ter tuning algorithm that is applicable to a broad range of machine learning systems. We evaluate its performance on a set of diverse benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our model surpasses the performance of well-established alternatives while consuming signiﬁcantly fewer resources. Fi- nally, we note that our approach is not necessarily speciﬁc to machine learning algorithms, but more generally applies to any process exhibiting an iterative structure to be exploited. 86 Broader Impact Our work aims at making the optimization of processes operating in a step-wise fashion more efﬁ- cient. As demonstrated this makes BOIL particularly well-suited to supporting supervised learning models and RL systems. By increasing training efﬁcience of these models, we hope to contribute to their widespread deployment whilst reducing the computational and therefore environmental cost their implementation has. Deep (reinforcement) learning systems ﬁnd application in a wide range of settings that directly contribute to real world decisions, e.g., natural language processing, visual task, autonomous driving and many more. As machine learning models building on our contributions are being deployed in the real world, we encourage practicioners to put in place necessary supervision and override mechanisms as precautions against potential failure. In a more general context, our algorithm may be seen as a step towards the construction of an automated pipeline for the training and deployment of machine learning models. A potential danger is that humans become further and further removed from the modelling process, making it harder to spot (potentially critical) failures. We do not see this as an argument against the construction of such a pipeline in principle, but instead encourage practicioners to reﬂect on potential biases indirectly encoded in the choice of data sets and models, they are feeding into said automated processes. The growing opacity of machine learning models is a concern of its own and which automated training procedures will only contribute to. Opposing this is a rapidly growing corpus of work addressing the interpretability of trained machine learning models and their decision making. These can and should be used to rigorously analyse ﬁnal training outcomes. Only then can we ensure that machine learning algorithm do indeed become a beneﬁcial source of information guiding real world policy making as opposed to opaque, unquestioned entities. While our main interest lies in the hyperparameter optimization of machine learning models, it should be noted that any iterative process depending on a set of parameters can make use of our con- tributions. Possible settings could, for instance, include the optimization of manufacturing pipelines in which factory setting are adjusted to increase productivity. 7 Acknowledgements S.

In 35th Conference on Uncertainty in Artiﬁcial Intelligence, 2019. 11The following sections are intended to give the reader further insights into our design choices and a deeper understanding of the algorithms properties. First, we give a brief overview of Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes. We then illustrate our models behavior on a two dimensional problem. Last, we give further details of our experiments for reproducibility purposes. A Bayesian Optimization Preliminaries Bayesian optimization is a sequential approach to global optimization of black-box functions with- out making use of derivatives. It uses two components: a learned surrogate model of the objective function and an acquisition function derived from the surrogate for selecting new points to inform the surrogate with. In-depth discussions beyond our brief overview can be found in recent surveys [2, 9, 35]. Notation. We summarize all of the notations used in our model in Table 1 for ease of reading. A.1 Gaussian processes We present the GP surrogate model for the black-box function f [31]. A GP deﬁnes a probability distribution over functions f under the assumption that any subset of points {(xi, f (xi)}is normally distributed. Formally, this is denoted as: f (x) ∼GP ( m(x),k ( x,x′)) , where m(x) and k (x,x′) are the mean and covariance functions, given by m(x) =E[ f (x)] and k(x,x′) =E [ ( f (x)−m(x))( f (x′)−m(x′))T ] . Typically, the mean of the GP is assumed to be zero everywhere. The kernel k(x,x′) can be thought of as a similarity measure relating f (x) and f (x′). Numerous kernels encoding different prior be- liefs about f (x) have been proposed. A popular choice is given by the square exponential kernel k(x,x′) =σ2 f exp [ −(x −x′)2/2σ2 l ] . The length- and output-scales σ2 l and σ2 f regulate the maximal covariance between two points and can be estimated using maximum marginal likelihood. The SE kernel encodes the belief that nearby points are highly correlated as it is maximized at k(x,x) =σ2 f and decays the further x and x′are separated. For predicting f∗= f (x∗) at a new data point x∗, assuming a zero mean m(x) =0, we have: [ f f∗ ] ∼N ( 0, [ K kT ∗ k∗ k∗∗ ]) (7) where k∗∗= k (x∗,x∗), k∗= [k (x∗,xi)]∀i≤N and K = [k (xi,xj)]∀i, j≤N . The conditional probability of p( f∗|f ) follows a univariate Gaussian distribution as p( f∗|f ) ∼N ( µ (x∗),σ2 (x∗) ) . Its mean and variance are given by: µ (x∗) =k∗K−1y σ2 (x∗) =k∗∗−k∗K−1kT ∗. As GPs give full uncertainty information with any prediction, they provide a ﬂexible nonparametric prior for Bayesian optimization. We refer the interested readers to [31] for further details on GPs. A.2 Acquisition function Bayesian optimization is typically applied in settings in which the objective function is expensive to evaluate. To minimize interactions with that objective, an acquisition function is deﬁned to reason about the selection of the next evaluation point xt+1 = argmaxx∈X αt (x). The acquisition func- tion is constructed from the predictive mean and variance of the surrogate to be easy to evaluate and represents the trade-off between exploration (of points with high predictive uncertainty) and exploitation (of points with high predictive mean). Thus, by design the acquisition function can be maximized with standard global optimization toolboxes. Among the many acquisition functions [12, 13, 14, 32, 40, 44] available in the literature, the expected improvement [14, 27, 45] is one of the most popular. 12Table 1: Notation List Parameter Domain Meaning d integer, N dimension, no. of hyperparameters to be optimized x vector,Rd input hyperparameter N integer, N maximum number of BO iterations Tmin, Tmax integer, N the min/max no of iterations for training a ML algorithm t ∈[Tmin,...Tmax] index of training steps M integer, N the maximum number of augmentation.

Although the raw learning curve in DRL is noisy, the transformed version using our proposed curve compression is smooth. Therefore, we use two squared exponential kernels for input hyperparameter and training iteration, respectively. That iskx(x,x′) =exp ( −||x−x′||2 2σ2x ) and kt (t,t′) =exp ( −||t−t′||2 2σ2t ) where the observation x and t are normalized to [0,1]d and the outcome y is standardized y ∼ N (0,1) for robustness. As a result, our product kernel becomes k ( [x,t],[x′,t′] ) = k(x,x′)×k(t,t′) =exp ( −||x −x′||2 2σ2x −||t −t′||2 2σ2t ) . The length-scales σx and σt are learnable parameters indicating the variability of the function with regards to the hyperparameter input x and number of training iterations t. Estimating appropriate values for them is critical as this represents the GPs prior regarding the sensitivity of performance w.r.t. changes in the number of training iterations and hyperparameters. For extremely large σt we expect the objective function to change very little for different numbers of training iterations. For small σt by contrast we expect drastic changes even for small differences. We estimate these GP hyperparameters (including the length-scalesσx, σt and the output noise varianceσy) by maximizing their log marginal likelihood [31]. We optimize Eq. (5) with a gradient-based optimizer, providing the analytical gradient to the algo- rithm. We start the optimization from the previous hyperparameter values θprev. If the optimization fails due to numerical issues, we keep the previous value of the hyperparameters. We reﬁt the hy- perparameters every 3×d function evaluations where d is the dimension.

(1), GP predictive variance in Eq. (2), the acquisition function in Eq. (3), the predicted function and the ﬁnal decision function in Eq. (8). These equations are deﬁned in the main manuscript. As shown in the respective ﬁgures the ﬁnal decision function balances between utility and cost of any pair (γ,t) to achieve iteration efﬁciency. Especially in situations where multiple locations share the same utility value, our decision will prefer to select the cheapest option. Using the augmented observations in Fig. 7, our joint space is ﬁlled quicker with points and the uncertainty (GP variance) across it reduces faster than in Fig. 8 – the case of vanilla CM-T/F-BO without augmenting obser- vations. A second advantage of having augmented observations is that the algorithm is discouraged to select the same hyperparameter setting at lower ﬁdelity than a previous evaluation. We do not add the full curve as it can be redundant while causing the conditioning problem of the GP covariance matrix. B.1 Experiment settings We summarize the hyperparameter search ranges for A2C on Reacher and InvertedPendulum in Table 3, CNN on SHVN in Table 4 and DDQN on CartPole in Table 2. Additionally, we present the best found parameter x∗for these problems. Further details of the DRL agents are listed in Table 5. B.2 Learning Logistic Function We ﬁrst present the Logistic curve l(u |x,t) = 1 1+exp(−g0[u−m0]) using different choices of g0 and m0 in Fig. 10. We then learn from the data to get the optimal choices g∗ 0 and m∗ 0 presented in Fig. 11.

B.3 Robustness over Different Preference Functions We next study the learning effects with respect to different choices of the preference functions. We pick three preference functions including the Sigmoid, Log and Average to compute the utility score for each learning curve. Then, we report the best found reward curve under such choices. The experiments are tested using A2C on Reacher-v2. The results presented in Fig. 9 demonstrate the robustness of our model with the preference functions. B.4 Applying Freeze-Thaw BO in the settings considered While both the exponential decay in Freeze-Thaw BO [42] and our compression function encode preferences regarding training development, there is an important distinction between the two ap- proaches. Freeze-thaw BO utilises the exponential decay property to terminate the training curve, while BOIL only uses the sigmoid curve to guide the search. We refer to Fig. 13 for further illustra- tion of why Freeze-thaw BO struggles in DRL settings. B.5 Ablation Study using Freeze-Thraw Kernel for Time In the joint modeling framework of hyperparameter and time (iteration), we can replace the kernel either k(x,x) or k(t,t) with different choices. We, therefore, set up a new baseline of using the time- kernel k(t,t′) in Freeze-Thaw approach [42] which encodes the monotonously exponential decay from the curve. Particularly, we use the kernel deﬁned as k(t,t′) = βα (t +t′+β)α for parameters α,β > 0 which are optimized in the GP models. 186  4  2  0 2 4 6 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Estimated l( . | m * 0 ,g * 0 ) for CartPole m * 0 =-3.266   g * 0 =3.0 6  4  2  0 2 4 6 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Estimated l(m * 0 ,g * 0 ) for CNN_SHVN m * 0 =2.245   g * 0 =2.092 6  4  2  0 2 4 6 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Estimated l(m * 0 ,g * 0 ) for InvPendulum m * 0 =1.649   g * 0 =1.833 6  4  2  0 2 4 6 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Estimated l( . | m * 0 ,g * 0 ) for Cifar10 m * 0 =-4.0   g * 0 =1.476 6  4  2  0 2 4 6 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Estimated l( . | m * 0 ,g * 0 ) for Reacher m * 0 =2.779   g * 0 =1.973 Figure 11: We learn the suitable transformation curve directly from the data.

Freeze-thaw BO will terminate training processes when training performance (in blue) signiﬁcantly drops (i.e. at the red locations) as the exponential decay model will predict low ﬁnal performance. In most RL enviroments noisy training curves are unavoidable. Thus, Freeze-thaw BO will dismiss all curves including good setting, never completing a single training run before the ﬁnal epoch. /uni00000013

Comparison using freezethaw kernel for time component. We present the result in Fig. 14 that CM-T/F-BO is still less competitive to BOIL using this speciﬁc time kernel. The results again validate the robustness our approach cross different choices of kernel. B.6 Additional Experiments for Tuning DRL and CNN We present the additional experiments for tuning a DRL model using InvertedPendulum environ- ment and a CNN model using a subset of CIFAR10 in Fig. 12. Again, we show that the proposed model clearly gain advantages against the baselines in tuning hyperparameters for model with itera- tive learning information available. B.7 Examples of Deep Reinforcement Learning Training Curves Finally, we present examples of training curves produced by the deep reinforcement learning al- gorithm A2C in Fig. 15. These ﬂuctuate widely and it may not be trivial to deﬁne good stopping criteria as done for other applications in previous work [42]. 200 200 400 80 70 60 50 40 0 200 400 110 100 90 80 70 60 50 0 200 400 110 100 90 80 70 60 50 0 200 400 70 60 50 40 30 0 200 400 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 200 400 50 40 30 20 0 200 400 90 80 70 60 50 0 200 400 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 200 400 85 80 75 70 0 200 400 60 50 40 30 20 0 200 400 100 90 80 70 60 0 200 400 100 90 80 70 0 200 400 80 60 40 20 0 200 400 100 90 80 70 60 0 200 400 100 90 80 70 0 200 400 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 0 200 400 70 60 50 40 30 20 0 200 400 70 60 50 40 30 20 0 200 400 100 90 80 70 60 50 0 200 400 70 60 50 40 30 20 0 200 400 100 90 80 70 60 50 0 200 400 100 90 80 70 60 0 200 400 60 50 40 30 20 0 200 400 80 60 40 20 0 200 400 85 80 75 70 65 60 0 200 400 100 95 90 85 80 0 200 400 80 60 40 20 0 200 400 100 90 80 70 60 50 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0 500 1000 1500 0 50 100 150 200 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Figure 15: Examples of reward curves using A2C on Reacher-v2 (rows 1 −3) and on InvertedPendulum-v2 (rows 4 −6). Y-axis is the reward averaged over 100 consecutive episodes. X-axis is the episode. The noisy performance illustrated is typical of DRL settings and complicates the design of early stopping criteria. Due to the property of DRL, it is not trivial to decide when to stop the training curve. In addition, it will be misleading if we only take average over the last 100 iterations. 21",

        "main_contributions": "The paper introduces Bayesian Optimization for Iterative Learning (BOIL), an approach for efficient hyperparameter tuning of deep (reinforcement) learning systems. It addresses the high computational cost and iterative nature of training by: 1) proposing an algorithm to optimize the entire learning curve (instead of just final performance) through training curve compression into a single numeric score representing both training success and stability, 2) learning this compression function from data, and 3) employing a data augmentation technique that leverages intermediate training information to increase sample-efficiency and selectively include scores from different training steps while managing computational cost and avoiding Gaussian Process (GP) covariance conditioning issues. The method is demonstrated to outperform baselines in identifying optimal hyperparameters in minimal wall-clock time for DRL agents and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).",
        "methodology": "The BOIL framework models the cost-sensitive black-box objective function f(x,t) (hyperparameter x and iterations t) as a Gaussian Process (GP) with a product kernel combining similarities over parameter and iteration space. Training time cost c(x,t) is approximated by a linear regressor. It uses a modified Expected Improvement acquisition function that balances high function value, high uncertainty, and low cost. A key component is training curve compression, where the entire learning curve r(·|x,t) is transformed into a single numeric utility score using a Sigmoid function l(·|m0,g0), whose parameters m0 and g0 are learned by maximizing the GP's log marginal likelihood. To improve sample-efficiency and prevent GP covariance matrix ill-conditioning, a data augmentation technique is used to selectively sample a subset of points from the observed learning curve, focusing on areas of high GP predictive uncertainty, rather than including the full curve.",
        "experimental_setup": "Experiments were conducted on a NVIDIA 1080 GTX GPU using tensorflow-gpu, with results averaged over 20 independent runs with different random seeds. For Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), hyperparameters were tuned for a Dueling DQN agent on the CartPole-v0 environment and Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) agents on InvertedPendulum-v2 and Reacher-v2, leveraging OpenAI Gym and Mujoco. For Deep Learning (DL), hyperparameters were tuned for a Convolutional Neural Network on the SVHN and CIFAR10 datasets. The BOIL model used square-exponential kernels for its Gaussian Process, with kernel parameters and Logistic function parameters (m0, g0) learned by maximizing marginal likelihood. A maximum of 15 augmented points were used, with a condition number threshold of 20 for the natural log of the GP covariance matrix. Baselines included Hyperband and Continuous Multi-Task/Fidelity Bayesian Optimization (CM-T/F-BO), along with ablation studies comparing to vanilla Bayesian Optimization (BO) and BO with only Logistic curve compression (BO-L).",
        "limitations": "The paper notes that the cost function c(x,t) is approximated by a linear regressor, suggesting that a more complex parametric model or a second Gaussian Process might be more appropriate if the cost has a more intricate dependency on hyperparameters and iterations. While the proposed data augmentation method addresses the ill-conditioning issues of the GP covariance matrix that arise from adding full training curves, the selection of the maximum number of augmented points (M=15) and the threshold for the natural log of the GP condition number (δ=20) are fixed, which might require tuning for different scenarios. The effectiveness relies on the assumption that learning progress can be meaningfully compressed into a single numeric score using a Sigmoid function, although the function parameters are learned from data, the functional form itself is pre-specified.",
        "future_research_directions": "The authors suggest that the BOIL framework can be extended beyond machine learning to other iterative processes that could benefit from exploiting their iterative structure, such as the optimization of manufacturing pipelines where factory settings are adjusted to increase productivity.

In this work, we propose a simple and efﬁcient way for optimizing hyperparameters inspired by the marginal likelihood, an optimization objective that requires no validation data.

Each partition is associated with and optimized only on speciﬁc data shards. Combining these partitions into subnetworks allows us to deﬁne the “out-of-training-sample” loss of a subnetwork, i.e., the loss on data shards unseen by the subnetwork, as the objective for hyperparameter optimization. We demonstrate that we can apply this objective to optimize a variety of different hyperparameters in a single training run while being signiﬁcantly computationally cheaper than alternative methods aiming to optimize the marginal likelihood for neural networks. Lastly, we also focus on optimizing hyperparameters in federated learning, where retraining and cross-validation are particularly challenging. 1 I NTRODUCTION Due to their remarkable generalization capabilities, deep neural networks have become the de-facto models for a wide range of complex tasks. Combining large models, large-enough datasets, and sufﬁcient computing capabilities enable researchers to train powerful models through gradient descent. Regardless of the data regime, however, the choice of hyperparameters — such as neural architecture, data augmentation strategies, regularization, or which optimizer to choose — plays a crucial role in the ﬁnal model’s generalization capabilities. Hyperparameters allow encoding good inductive biases that effectively constrain the models’ hypothesis space (e.g., convolutions for vision tasks), speed up learning, or prevent overﬁtting in the case of limited data. Whereas gradient descent enables the tuning of model parameters, accessing hyperparameter gradients is more complicated. The traditional and general way to optimize hyperparameters operates as follows; 1) partition the dataset into training and validation data1, 2) pick a set of hyperparameters and optimize the model on the training data, 3) measure the performance of the model on the validation data and ﬁnally 4) use the validation metric as a way to score models or perform search over the space of hyperparameters. This approach inherently requires training multiple models and consequently requires spending resources on models that will be discarded. Furthermore, traditional tuning requires a validation set since optimizing the hyperparameters on the training set alone cannot identify the right inductive biases. A canonical example is data augmentations — they are not expected to improve training set performance, but they greatly help with generalization. In the low data regime, deﬁning a validation set that cannot be used for tuning model parameters is undesirable. Picking the right amount of validation data is a hyperparameter in itself. The conventional rule of thumb to use ∼10% of all data can result in signiﬁcant overﬁtting, as pointed out by Lorraine et al. (2019) , when one has a sufﬁciently large number of hyperparameters to tune. Furthermore, a validation set can be challenging ∗Work done while at Qualcomm AI Research.

An example is Federated Learning (FL) (McMahan et al., 2017), which we speciﬁcally consider in our experimental section. In FL, each extra training run (for,e.g., a speciﬁc hyperparameter setting) comes with additional, non-trivial costs. Different approaches have been proposed in order to address these challenges. Some schemes optimize hyperparameters during a single training run by making the hyperparameters part of the model (e.g., learning dropout rates with concrete dropout (Gal et al., 2017), learning architectures with DARTs (Liu et al., 2018) and learning data-augmentations with schemes as in Benton et al. (2020); van der Wilk et al. (2018)). In cases where the model does not depend on the hyperparameters directly but only indirectly through their effect on the value of the ﬁnal parameters (through optimization), schemes for differentiating through the training procedures have been proposed, such as Lorraine et al. (2019). Another way of optimizing hyperparameters without a validation set is through the canonical view on model selection (and hence hyperparameter optimization) through the Bayesian lens; the concept of optimizing the marginal likelihood. For deep neural networks, however, the marginal likelihood is difﬁcult to compute. Prior works have therefore developed various approximations for its use in deep learning models and used those to optimize hyperparameters in deep learning, such as those of data augmentation (Schw¨obel et al., 2021; Immer et al., 2022). Still, however, these come at a signiﬁcant added computational expense and do not scale to larger deep learning problems. This paper presents a novel approach to hyperparameter optimization, inspired by the marginal likelihood, that only requires a single training run and no validation set. Our method is more scalable than previous works that rely on marginal likelihood and Laplace approximations (which require computing or inverting a Hessian (Immer et al., 2021)) and is broadly applicable to any hierarchical modelling setup. 2 M ARGINAL LIKELIHOOD AND PRIOR WORK In Bayesian inference, the rules of probability dictate how any unknown, such as parameters w or hyperparameters ψ, should be determined given observed data D. Let p(w) be a prior over w and p(D|w,ψ) be a likelihood for Dwith ψbeing the hyperparameters. We are then interested in the posterior given the data p(w|D,ψ) =p(D|w,ψ)p(w)/p(D|ψ). The denominator term p(D|ψ) is known as the marginal likelihood, as it measures the probability of observing the data given ψ, irrespective of the value of w: p(D|ψ) = ∫ p(w)p(D|w,ψ)dw. Marginal likelihood has many desirable properties that make it a good criterion for model selection and hyperparameter optimization. It intuitively implements the essence of Occam’s Razor principle (MacKay, 2003, § 28). In the PAC-Bayesian literature, it has been shown that higher marginal likelihood gives tighter frequentist upper bounds on the generalization performance of a given model class (McAllester, 1998; Germain et al., 2016). It also has close links to cross-validation (see section 2.1) and can be computed from the training data alone. However, computation of the marginal likelihood in deep learning models is usually prohibitively expensive and many recent works have proposed schemes to approximate the marginal likelihood for differentiable model selection (Lyle et al., 2020; Immer et al., 2021; 2022; Schw¨obel et al., 2021). 2.1 “L EARNING SPEED ” PERSPECTIVE Lyle et al. (2020); Fong and Holmes (2020) pointed out the correspondence between “learning speed” and marginal likelihood. Namely, the marginal likelihood of the data Dconditioned on some hyperparameters ψcan be written as: log p(D|ψ) = ∑ k log Ep(w|D1:k−1,ψ) [p(Dk|w,ψ)] ≥ ∑ k Ep(w|D1:k−1,ψ) [log p(Dk|w,ψ)] (1) where (D1,..., DC) is an arbitrary partitioning of the training dataset Dinto Cshards or chunks2, and p(w|D1:k,ψ) is the posterior over parameters of a function fw : X → Y, from the input domain Xto the target domain Yafter seeing data in shards 1 through k. The right-hand side can be interpreted as a type of cross-validation in which we ﬁx an ordering over the shards and measure the “validation” performance on each shardDk using a model trained on the preceding shards D1:k−1. 2We use the terms “chunk” and “shard” interchangeably. 2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Alternatively, it can be viewed as the learning speed of a (probabilistic) model: i.e., a measure of how quickly it learns to perform well on new shards of data after only having been ﬁt to the previous shards (through exact Bayesian updating). This perspective neatly illustrates why models with higher marginal likelihood can exhibit good inductive biases, e.g., encoded through ψ, w and fw. Namely, such models can be expected to learn faster and generalize better after seeing fewer samples. For example, if the hypothesis space is constrained3to functions satisfying symmetries present in the data, we need fewer data to identify the correct function (Sokolic et al., 2017; Sannai et al., 2021). We argue that the “learning speed” aspect of marginal likelihood — i.e., measuring how well the model generalizes to new data in the training set, having been trained only on the previous data points — is the key property making marginal likelihood a useful tool for selecting hyperparameters. 2.2 T RAINING SPEED FOR HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION Computing the “learning speed”, requires samples from the posteriorp(w|D1:k,ψ). Unfortunately, in deep learning settings, such samples are impractical to obtain; thus, prior works have focused on more scalable alternatives. Lyle et al. (2020) propose to approximate the objective in Eq. 1 by looking at the training speed during standard training of a neural network by SGD. Speciﬁcally, they deﬁne the training speed as the reduction in the training loss after a single SGD parameter update, summed over all updates in the ﬁrst epoch. They argue that, during the ﬁrst epoch of training, after the neural network parameters, w, have been updated with SGD steps using data from shards D1:k, they can be approximately used in place of the sample from the posterior p(w|D1:k,ψ) in Eq. 1. They extend the analogy to training past one epoch and use the training speed estimate for model selection (Ru et al., 2021). As pointed out by the authors, however, the analogy between learning speed and training speed somewhat breaks down after 1 epoch of training. The network parameters have “seen” every datapoint in the training set after1 epoch, and hence the connection to measuring the model’s generalization capability is weakened. For the sake of scalability and alignment with deep learning practice, we also focus on simple pointwise approximations qk(w) = δ(w = ˆwk) to the posteriors p(w|D1:k,ψ). However, in contrast to prior work, we explicitly parametrize the learning procedure such that, at any given training iteration, we have access to a model that is trained only on a subset of the dataD1:k. In doing so, we can approximate the objective in Eq. 1, and thus use it to optimize the hyperparameters during the entire training run. 3 P ARTITIONED NEURAL NETWORKS Our goal is to optimize the objective LML (D,ψ) = C∑ k=1 Eqk−1(w) [log p(Dk|w,ψ)] (2) wrt. ψ, which is an approximation to the lower-bound presented in Eq. 1 above. In Appendix A, we show that the left-hand side is also a lower-bound on the marginal likelihood under some unobtrusive conditions. As mentioned in Section 2.2, our goal is to propose an architecture and a training scheme so that we can easily obtain models trained on only subsets of the data D1:k for all k throughout training. We propose that each {qk(w)}C k=1 optimizes a subset of the parameters of the neural network, in a manner that allows us to extract “subnetworks” from the main network that have been trained on speciﬁc chunks of data. We describe the partitioning scheme below. Partitioning the parameters Denote the concatenations of the weights of a neural networkw ∈RN. We can deﬁne a partitioning ((w1,..., wC),P) of the parameters into C partitions, such that w = Pconcat(w1,..., wC) for a permutation matrix P ∈{0,1}N×N. For ease of exposition, we drop the dependence on P, assuming that w is already arranged such that P is identity, P = IN×N. Given the partitioning (w1,..., wC) of the parameters, we then specify Csubnetworks with weights w(1) s ,..., w(C) s such that w(k) s = concat(w1,..., wk, ˆwk+1,..., ˆwC), where ˆwi are some default 3or if the learning algorithm is heavily biased towards returning hypotheses that satisfy a given invariance, e.g., through the use of a prior. 3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 values not optimized during training4. More speciﬁcally, the k-th subnetwork, wk s, retains the ﬁrst kpartitions from the weight partitioning and sets the remaining parameters to ˆwk+1:C. Note that, if each wk is only updated on chunks D1:k, the subnetwork w(k) s is only comprised of weights that have been updated on D1:k. Thus, we can view the parameters of w(k) s as an approximation to qk(w). Although, given that a subset of the parameters in each w(k) s is ﬁxed, this would likely be a poor approximation to the true posterior over the weights given D1:k, it could be, intuitively, a reasonable approximation in function space5. Partitioned training Having partitioned the dataset Dinto Cchunks (D1,..., Dk), we update each partition wk by optimising the negative log-likelihood6on chunks D1:k using subnetwork w(k) s by computing the following gradients: ∇wkL ( D1:k,w(k) s ) = ∑ (x,y)∈D1:k ∇wk log p ( y ⏐⏐⏐x; w(k) s ,ψ ) . (3) We interleave stochastic gradient updates of each partition of the weights with updating the hyperpa- rameters ψusing LML in Eq. 2: ∇ψLML (D,ψ) ≈ C∑ k=2 ∑ (x,y)∈Dk ∇ψlog p ( y ⏐⏐⏐x,w(k−1) s ,ψ ) . (4) This can be seen as the sum of the out-of-sample losses for each subnetwork w(k) s . The scheme is illustrated in Figure 1. For details of how the updates are scheduled in our experiments, see Appendix I. Note that, while we could incorporate the gradient of the ﬁrst term from Eq. 1 corresponding to Eq0(w)[log p(D1|w,ψ)] in Eq. 4, we chose to leave it out. Hence, the gradient of Eq. 4 is of an estimate that can be viewed as an approximation to the conditional marginal likelihood log p(D2:C|D1,ψ). Conditional marginal likelihood has been shown to have many desirable properties for model selection and, in many cases, can be a better proxy for generalization (Lotﬁ et al., 2022).

Illustration of the partitioning scheme for a single hidden layer perceptron with C = 3chunks. This procedure, inspired by the marginal likelihood, has several desirable properties compared to prior work. 1) Our objective is computationally efﬁcient, with a computational cost roughly corresponding to evaluating subnetworks on the training set. There is no need to compute nor invert a Hessian with 4e.g., ˆwi could be the value of the weights at initialization, or ˆwi = 0 corresponding to pruning those parameters and obtaining a proper subnetwork. 5Since a) the mapping from parameters to functions is not bijective and b) neural networks are highly overparameterised and can be heavily pruned while retaining performance (Frankle and Carbin, 2018), obtaining a good ﬁt to a subset of the training data with a subset of the model parameters should be possible. Furthermore, “scaling laws” indicate that the beneﬁt of having more parameters becomes apparent mostly for larger dataset sizes (Kaplan et al., 2020), thus it is reasonable for subnetworks ﬁt to more data to have more learnable parameters. 6Optionally with an added negative log-prior regularization term log p(w(k) s ). 4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 respect to the weights, as in the Laplace approximation (Immer et al., 2021; 2022). 2) Our objective is readily amenable to optimization by stochastic gradient descent; we do not have to iterate over the entire training set to compute a single gradient update for the hyperparameters. 3) Compared to the training speed objective (Lyle et al., 2020), in our method, the training of the weights in each subnetwork progresses independently of the data in future chunks. Hence, it can be seen as more truthfully measuring the generalization capability of a model using a given set of hyperparameters. Partitioning Schemes There are several ways in which the neural network weights can be partitioned. In our experiments in Section 5, we partition the weights before beginning training by assigning a ﬁxed proportion of weights in each layer to a given partition at random. For each subnetwork, for the weight partitions corresponding to future chunks, we use the values of the weights at initialisation. For a discussion of partitioning schemes, see Appendix C. 4 R ELATED WORKS Hyperparameter optimization in deep learning Many works have tackled the challenge of op- timizing hyperparameters in deep learning. Works on implicit differentiation, such as the one by Lorraine et al. (2019), allow for optimizing training hyperparameters such as the learning rate, weight- decay, or other hyperparameters that affect the ﬁnal neural network weights only through the training routine. Other works have proposed ways to parameterize and optimize data-augmentations (Cubuk et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020), search-spaces for neural network architectures, as well as methods to optimize architectures using gradient-based optimization (Liu et al., 2018; Elsken et al., 2019). All of the above works have primarily relied on optimizing hyperparameters on a separate validation set and are compatible with the objective deﬁned in this work. Several works have also aimed to cast learning data augmentations as an invariance learning problem. They do so by parameterizing the model itself with data augmentations, and frame invariance learning as a model selection problem (van der Wilk et al., 2018; Benton et al., 2020; Schw¨obel et al., 2021; Nabarro et al., 2022; Immer et al., 2022). We compare against Benton et al. (2020) (“Augerino”) and Immer et al. (2022) (“Differentiable Laplace”) on this task in the experimental section. Hyperparameter optimization without a validation set A limited number of works consider learning hyperparameters without a validation set in a deep learning context. Benton et al. (2020) propose a simple method for learning invariances without a validation set by regularising invariance hyperparameters to those resulting in higher invariance. They show that the invariances found tend to be insensitive to the regularisation strength, determined by another hyperparameter. However, the method relies on being able to a priori deﬁne which hyperparameters lead to higher invariance through a suitable regularisation function. In more complex invariance learning settings, deﬁning the regulariser can be challenging. For example, if data-augmentation transformations were to be parameterized by a neural network (as proposed in Lorraine et al. (2019)), it is non-trivial to devise an adequate regulariser. We show that our method can be applied to such settings. Other works focus on deriving tractable approximations to the marginal likelihood for deep neural networks. Schw ¨obel et al. (2021) propose only marginalising-out the parameters in the last layer of the neural network by switching it out for a Gaussian Process. They treat the preceding layer effectively as a hyperparameter, and optimize invariance parameters using the marginal likelihood. Although they show promising results on MNIST, they found they “were unable to learn invariances for CIFAR-10” (Schw¨obel et al., 2021, §7) and highlighted the need to marginalise lower layers as well. In contrast, our objective can be seen as being inspired by marginal likelihood where arbitrary network layers can be “marginalised”, and works on datasets like CIFAR-10. Immer et al. (2022) have adapted the Laplace approximation (Immer et al., 2021) to make it tractable for learning data augmentations. In contrast to Schw¨obel et al. (2021), they approximately marginalize out all the network parameters, and performs favourably. Their approximation, however, requires approximations to a Hessian w.r.t. all network parameters; for that reason, their work reports results for architectures only up to a ResNet-14, whereas our method can easily scale to larger architectures. Hyperparameter optimization in FL Improving hyperparameter optimization is especially rele- vant to FL. Given the potential system level constraints (Wang et al., 2021), methods that optimize the hyperparameters and parameters in a single training run are preferred. On this note, Khodak et al. (2021) introduced FedEx and showed that it can successfully optimize the client optimizer 5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 hyperparameters. FedEx relies on a training/validation split on the client level and uses a REIN- FORCE type of gradient (Williams, 1992) estimator, which usually exhibits high variance and needs baselines to reduce it (Mohamed et al., 2020). This is in contrast to partitioned networks, which use standard, low-variance backpropagation for the hyperparameters and no separate validation set per client. To optimize the other hyperparameters, Khodak et al. (2021) wrapped FedEx with a traditional hyperparameter optimization strategy, the successive halving algorithm. This is orthogonal to our method and could be applied to partitioned networks as well. In Zhou et al. (2021), the authors perform a hyperparameter search independently on each client with some off-the-shelf methods and then aggregate the results of the search at the server once in order to identify the best hyperparameter setting. The main drawback of this method compared to partitioned networks is that when the local client datasets are small, a client-speciﬁc validation set is not informative, and the aggregation happens only once. Finally, there is also the recent work from Seng et al. (2022) which performs hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search in the federated setting. Similarly to prior works, it requires client-speciﬁc validation data in order to optimize the hyperparameters. 5 E XPERIMENTS 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 Num. inputs 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 Accuracy 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 Average Log-likelihoodPosthoc Diagonal Laplace Train T est 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 Num. inputs 103 102 Log Marginal Likelihood Estimate Partitioned (a) 0 400080001200016000200002400028000 Iteration 0 5 10 15 20 25Input Mask Element 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Mask Probability  (b) Figure 2: (a) Demonstrating the ability of the marginal-likelihood inspired objective LML to identify the correct model on a toy input selection task.

(b) Mask over input features learned by partitioned networks over time. The ﬁrst 15 features are correctly identiﬁed. Input Selection To demonstrate that LML is a good objective for model selection that captures the desirable properties of the marginal likelihood, we ﬁrst deploy our method on the toy model selection task of Lyle et al. (2020): there the ﬁrst 15 features are informative, and the remaining15 are spurious y∼Bern (1 2 ) x = [ y+ ϵ1,...,y + ϵ15   Informative ,ϵ16,...,ϵ 30   Spurious ]⊺ ϵ1,...,ϵ 30 iid ∼N(0,1). We specify a ﬁxed mask over the inputs prior to training, where the ﬁrst Kinputs remain unmasked, and the remainder is masked. We expect that, given multiple models with different (ﬁxed) masks over the inputs, the proposed objective will be able to identify the correct one — i.e., the one that keeps only the informative features. We train multiple fully connected neural networks (MLPs) on a training set of 1000 examples using our method and compare the ﬁnal values of the LML objective. The results are shown in Figure 2a. LML correctly identiﬁes 15 input features as the optimum, and correlates well with test accuracy and log-likelihood. Training loss and training accuracy, on the other hand, cannot alone disambiguate whether to use 15 or more input features. Differentiable input selection We further show that we can learn the correct mask over the inputs in a differentiable manner using our method during a single training run. We parameterize a learnable mask over the inputs with a concrete Bernoulli distribution (Maddison et al., 2016) and treat the parameters of the mask distribution as a hyperparameter. We optimize them with respect to the proposed objective using our method. The evolution of the learned mask during training is shown in Figure 2b, where we see that we can correctly identify the ﬁrst 15 informative features. 6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Learning invariances through data-augmentations Following previous literature on learning soft invariances through learning data augmentations (Nabarro et al., 2022; van der Wilk et al., 2018; Benton et al., 2020; Schw ¨obel et al., 2021; Immer et al., 2022), we show that we can learn useful afﬁne image augmentations, resulting in gains in test accuracy. We specify afﬁne data augmentations as part of a probabilistic model as done by van der Wilk et al. (2018), averaging over multiple data augmentation samples during training and inference. This allows us to treat the data-augmentation distribution as a model hyperparameter rather than a training hyperparameter. For datasets, we consider MNIST, CIFAR10, TinyImagenet along with rotCIFAR10 and rotTinyImagenet, variants where the datapoints are randomly rotated at the beginning of training by angles sampled uniformly from [−π,π] (Immer et al., 2022). Experimental setup details are provided in Appendix I. For the CIFAR10 and rotCIFAR10 datasets, we consider as baselines standard training with no augmentations, Augerino (Benton et al., 2020) and Differentiable Laplace (Immer et al., 2022). Following Immer et al. (2022), we use ﬁxupResNets (Zhang et al., 2019) for the architectures. The results can be seen in Table 1. There, we observe that partitioned networks outperform all baselines in the case of CIFAR10 for both ResNet variants we consider. On RotCIFAR10, we observe that partitioned networks outperform the baseline and Augerino, but it is slightly outperformed by Differentiable Laplace, which optimizes additional prior hyperparameters. To demonstrate the scalability of partitioned networks, for the (rot)TinyImagenet experiments we consider a ResNet-50 architecture with GroupNorm(2). In Table 1 we observe that in both cases, partitioned networks learn invariances successfully and improve upon the baseline. Relative to Augerino, we observe that partitioned networks either improve (TinyImagenet) or are similar (rotTinyImagenet).

To show that, we perform experiments where we artiﬁcially reduce the size of the training dataset. The results can be seen in Figure 3. We see that by learning augmentations with partitioned networks, we can drastically improve performance in the low-data regime upon a baseline that does not learn augmentations, while performing favorably against prior works in most cases. On MNIST, our method outperforms the last-layer marginal-likelihood method (last-layer ML) by Schw¨obel et al. (2021) in the large data regime but underperforms in the low-data regime. That is likely to be expected, as their work ﬁts a Gaussian Process (GP) at the last layer (Wilson et al., 2016), which is better tailored for the low-data regime and results into a more ﬂexible model (due to the GP corresponding to an additional, inﬁnite width, layer). Since the MNIST-CNN is sufﬁciently small to ﬁt multiple networks into memory, we also compare to a variant of our method where, instead of partitioning a single network, we train Cdifferent networks where network kis ﬁt on data D1:k. This serves as an upper bound on the performance of the partitioned networks. We see that by partitioning a single network, we can achieve almost equivalent accuracy. On CIFAR10, partitioned networks outperform all other works on all data sizes we considered. On RotCIFAR10, partitioned networks perform again favourably, but they are marginally outperformed by differentiable Laplace in the low-data regime. Compared to partitioned networks where we only optimize augmentations, differentiable Laplace also optimizes the precision of a Gaussian prior over the weights, which better combats overﬁtting in the low-data regime. On both the TinyImagenet and rotTinyImagenet experiments we observe that partitioned networks either outperform or are similar to the baselines on all data sizes considered. 7Out of memory error on a 32GB Nvidia V100. 7Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 5000 20000 60000 Dataset Size 0.98 0.99T est Accuracy Baseline Last-layer ML Augerino Diff.

Comparisons to traditional training / validation split We further perform comparisons between partitioned networks and the more traditional training/validation split (denoted as validation set optimization) with additional ﬁnetuning to the task of learning data augmentations. This is realized as follows; we partition 20kCIFAR10 examples into training and validation data of speciﬁc proportions. We then either train a partitioned network (along with the hyperparameters on LML) on these two chunks of data or train a standard network on the training set while using the validation set loss to obtain gradients for the data augmentation hyperparameters. For the validation set optimization baseline, once the hyperparameters are optimized, the resulting network is ﬁnetuned on the whole dataset for 20 epochs. The results for varying chunk proportions are provided in Table 2. Table 2: Learning afﬁne augmentations with ﬁxupResNet-14 on subset of CIFAR-10 (20kexamples). NaN denotes that a run crashed.

The gap does get smaller when we move to the more tra- ditional 90/10 splits for train- ing/validation: a 10% proportion for validation data is enough to optimize a handful of hyper- parameters (just 6 scalars). To corroborate this claim, we set up an additional experiment; we use a Wide ResNet-20 on the full CIFAR10 dataset, where the ﬁrst two out of the three stages (13 convolution layers) are considered as hyperparameters. The results for this setting can be seen in Table 3. We see that 10% validation data are not enough, and the validation set optimization baseline performs poorly. This is in contrast to partitioned networks, where with three chunks, we can learn all of these hyperparameters successfully. Note that, compared to Augerino, applying partitioned networks to this setting is straightforward. To apply Augerino, one would have to come up with a metric that can be used to regularize the feature extractor towards “higher invariance”. Partitioned networks for federated learning We consider federated learning (FL) (McMahan et al., 2017), a setting where data is distributed across many clients. In this setting, there are system properties that make hyperparameter optimization especially challenging (Wang et al., 2021). More speciﬁcally, obtaining a validation set and performing multiple training runs with different 8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 hyperparameter settings might not be possible due to the additional communication and computation costs, and transient client availability (clients join and leave the training process at any time). Optimizing hyperparameters together with the model parameters in a single run is therefore especially beneﬁcial (Wang et al., 2021), and partitioned networks are a good ﬁt for FL. We extend our centralized experimental setup to FL by splitting all N clients into Cnon-overlapping chunks, such that each chunk is understood as the union of all clients’ data shards that belong to that chunk. During federated training, a client belonging to chunk ksequentially optimizes partitions wk:C through sub-networks w(k:C) s and computes a gradient wrt. the hyperparameters ψ. Note that partitions w1:k remain unchanged and do not need to be communicated back to the server. This reduction in upload costs is a welcome property for FL, where upload costs can bottleneck system design. The server receives the (hyper-) parameter updates, averages them, and applies the result as a “gradient” to the server-side model in the traditional federated manner (Reddi et al., 2020). For partitioned networks, the hyperparameters that we optimize are the data augmentation parameters and, since we also include dropout in these architectures, the dropout rates (with the concrete relaxation from Maddison et al. (2016)). As a baseline, we consider the standard federated training without learning hyperparameters (denoted as FedAvg) as well as learning the augmentation parameters with Augerino Benton et al. (2020). Please see Appendix J for a detailed explanation of our FL setup. Table 4 summarizes our results using different sub-sets and variations of MNIST and CIFAR10, where we also included rotMNIST Larochelle et al. (2007) as another dataset. We can see that partitioned networks allow training models that generalize better than both FedAvg and FedAvg with Augerino, at reduced communication costs. Especially when the true data-generating process and underlying source of non-i.i.d.-ness are explicitly accounted for — here in the form of rotation — the beneﬁts of learning the augmentations with partitioned networks become apparent. For example, we observe that on the rotated datasets, partitioned networks learn to correctly increase the rotation angle. Table 4: Validation accuracy averaged over the last10 evaluations, each 10 rounds apart; standard- error is computed across 4 random seeds. All datasets are adapted to the federated setting and are synthetically split to be non-i.i.d. sampled as described in Appendix J.2.

It provides a general and scalable solution to ﬁnding hyperparameters in a single training run without requiring access to a validation set while introducing less additional overhead to the training task than existing approaches. We showed that partitioned networks are applicable on a wide range of tasks; they can identify the correct model on illustrative toy examples, they can learn data augmentations in a way that improves data efﬁciency, they can optimize general feature extractors as hyperparameters and they can also optimize dropout rates. In the federated setting, partitioned networks allow us to overcome practical challenges, reduce the communication overhead and obtain better models. The notion of partitioned networks we propose in this work is novel to the literature and an orthogonal approach to many existing hyperparameter tuning algorithms. Like any other method, partitioned networks come with their own limitations, e.g., needing a partitioning strategy. We expand upon them in appendix H. We hope to see our method successfully reducing the need to perform hyperparameter search through repeated training and thereby contribute to the community’s effort to reduce its carbon footprint. 9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 REFERENCES Gregory Benton, Marc Finzi, and Andrew G Wilson.

(on page 6) 12Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 A LML IS A LOWER -BOUND TO THE MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD In this section, we show that the objective in equation 2 is a lower-bound on the marginal likelihood, under a mild assumption on each approximate posterior qk(w). The aim is to approximate: log p(D|ψ) = C∑ k=1 log p(Dk|D1:k−1,ψ) (5) Our partitioned approximation is given by: C∑ k=1 Eqk−1(w) [log p(Dk|w,ψ)] (6) We can get the equation for the gap between quantities in 5 and 6: gap = C∑ k=1 log p(Dk|D1:k−1,ψ) − C∑ k=1 Eqk−1(w) [log p(Dk|w,ψ)] (7) = C∑ k=1 Eqk−1(w) [log p(Dk|D1:k−1,ψ) −log p(Dk|w,ψ)] (8) = C∑ k=1 Eqk−1(w) [ log p(Dk|D1:k−1,ψ) p(Dk|w,ψ) ] (9) = C∑ k=1 Eqk−1(w)  log p(w,Dk|D1:k−1)    p(w|D1:k,ψ)p(Dk|D1:k−1,ψ)p(w|D1:k−1,ψ) p(w|D1:k,ψ)p(Dk|w,ψ)p(w|D1:k−1,ψ)   p(w,Dk|D1:k−1)   (10) = C∑ k=1 Eqk−1(w) [ log p(w|D1:k−1,ψ) p(w|D1:k,ψ) ] (11) = C∑ k=1 DKL [qk−1(w)∥p(w|D1:k,ψ)] −DKL [qk−1(w)∥p(w|D1:k−1,ψ)] (12) We now make two assumptions • DKL [qk−1(w)∥p(w|D1:k,ψ)] ≥DKL [qk(w)∥p(w|D1:k,ψ)]. This is motivated from the fact that qk(w) is trained on all data chunks D1:k so it is expected to be a better approxima- tion to the posterior p(w|D1:k), compared to qk−1(w) which is only trained on D1:k−1. • DKL [qC−1(w)∥p(w|D1:C,ψ)] ≥DKL [q0(w)∥p(w)]. Since we are free to choose the approximate posterior before seeing any data — q0(w)—, we can set it to be equal to the prior p(w) which, together with the positivity of the KL divergence, trivially satisﬁes this assumption. Therefore, by rearranging Eq. 12 and using our two assumptions we have that the gap is positive gap =−DKL [q0(w)∥p(w)] +DKL [qC−1(w)∥p(w|D1:C,ψ)] + C∑ k=1 DKL [qk−1(w)∥p(w|D1:k,ψ)] −DKL [qk(w)∥p(w|D1:k,ψ)] ≥0, (13) and our approximation is a lower bound to the marginal likelihood, i.e., log p(D|ψ) ≥ C∑ k=1 Eqk−1(w) [log p(Dk|w,ψ)] . (14) 13Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 B P ARTITIONED NETWORKS AS A SPECIFIC APPROXIMATION TO THE MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD In this section of the appendix, we show that the partitioned neural networks we presented in the paper are a particular instance of the approximation to the marginal likelihood shown in equation 2. Consider a dataset Dcomprised of C shards, i.e. D= (D1,..., DC), along with a model, e.g., a neural network, with parameters w ∈RDw, a prior p(w) = ∏Dw j=1 N(wj|0,λ) and a likelihood p(D|w,ψ) with hyperparameters ψ. Assuming a sequence over the dataset chunks, we can write out the true marginal likelihood as log p(D|ψ) = ∑ k log p(Dk|D1:k−1,ψ) = ∑ k log Ep(w|D1:k−1,ψ) [p(Dk|w,ψ)] (15) ≥ ∑ k Ep(w|D1:k−1,ψ) [log p(Dk|w,ψ)] . (16) Since the true posteriors p(w|D1:j,ψ) for j ∈{1,...,C }are intractable, we can use variational inference to approximate them with qφj(w) for j ∈{1,...,C }, with φj being the to-be-optimized parameters of the j’th variational approximation. Based on the result from Appendix A, whenqφj(w) are optimized to match the respective posteriors p(w|D1:j,ψ), we can use them to approximate the marginal likelihood as log p(D|ψ) ≥ ∑ k Eqφk−1 (w) [log p(Dk|w,ψ)] . (17) Partitioned networks correspond to a speciﬁc choice for the sequence of approximating distribution families qφk(w). Speciﬁcally, we partition the parameter space w into Cchunks, i.e., wk ∈RDwk, such that ∑ kDwk = Dw, and we associate each parameter chunk wk with a data shard Dk. Let rφk(wk) be base variational approximations over wk with parameters φk. Each approximate distribution qφk(w) is then deﬁned in terms of these base approximations, i.e., qφk(w) =   k−1∏ j=1 rφj(wj)  rφk(wk) ( K∏ m=k+1 r0(wm) ) (18) where r0(·) is some base distribution with no free parameters. In accordance with the assumptions in appendix A, we can then ﬁt each qφk(w) by minimising the KL-divergence to p(w|D1:k,ψ) – the posterior after seeing kchunks: DKL [qφk(w)∥p(w|D1:k,ψ)] =−Eqφk(w)[log p(D1:k|w,ψ)] +DKL [qφk(w)∥p(w)] + logp(D1:k|ψ) (19) (20) Finding the optimum with respect to φk: arg min φk DKL [qφk(w)∥p(w|D1:k,ψ)] = (21) = arg min φk −Eqφk(w)[log p(D1:k|w,ψ)] +DKL [qφk(w)∥p(w)] (22) = arg min φk −Eqφk(w)[log p(D1:k|w,ψ)] + DKL     k−1∏ j=1 rφj(wj)  rφk(wk) ( K∏ m=k+1 r0(wm) ) ∥ K∏ i p(wi)   (23) = arg min φk −Eqφk(w)[log p(D1:k|w,ψ)] +DKL [rφk(wk)∥p(wk)] . (24) We can now obtain partitioned networks by assuming that rφk(wk) = N(wk|φk,νI) for k ∈ {1,...,C }, r0(w) = N(w|ˆw,νI), with ˆw being the parameters at initialization (i.e., before we 14Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 update them on data) and taking ν →0, i.e., in machine-precision, the weights are deterministic. As noted in Section I.1, we scale the weight-decay regularizer forφk (whenever used) differently for each partition k, such that it can be interpreted as regularization towards a prior. In the experiments where we do not regularize φk according to p(wk) when we optimize them, this implicitly corresponds to λ→∞ (i.e. the limiting behaviour when the variance of p(w) goes to inﬁnity), which makes the contribution of the regularizer negligible. C P ARTITIONING SCHEMES There are several ways in which we could aim to partition the weights of a neural network. Throughout the experimental section 5, we partition the weights by assigning a ﬁxed proportion of weights in each layer to a given partition at random. We call this approach random weight partitioning. We also experimented with other partitioning schemes. For example, we tried assigning a ﬁxed proportion of a layer’s outputs (e.g., channels in a convolution layer) to each partition. All weights in a given layer that a speciﬁc output depends on would then be assigned to that partition. We call this approach node partitioning. Both approaches are illustrated in Figure 4. One beneﬁt of the node partitioning scheme is that it makes it possible to update multiple partitions with a single batch; This is because we can make a forward pass at each linear or convolutional layer with the full network parameters w, and, instead, mask the appropriate inputs and outputs to the layer to retrieve an equivalent computation to that with w(k) s . The gradients also need to be masked on the backward pass adequately. No such simpliﬁcation is possible with the random weight partitioning scheme; if we were to compute a backward pass for a single batch of examples using different subnetworks for each example, the memory overhead would grow linearly with the number of subnetworks used. In initial experiments, we found both random weight partitioning and node partitioning performed similarly. In the experimental section 5, we focused on the former, as it’s easier to reason about with relation to e.g., dropout. Throughout this work, partitioning happens prior to initiating training, and remains ﬁxed throughout. It might also be possible to partition the network parameters dynamically during training, which we leave for future work.   w11 w12 w13 w14 w15 w21 w22 w23 w24 w25 w31 w32 w33 w34 w35 w41 w42 w43 w44 w45 w51 w52 w53 w54 w55 w61 w62 w63 w64 w65   (a) Random weight partitioned In node assignment    Out node assignment      w11 w12 w13 w14 w15 w21 w22 w23 w24 w25 w31 w32 w33 w34 w35 w41 w42 w43 w44 w45 w51 w52 w53 w54 w55 w61 w62 w63 w64 w65   (b) Node partitioned Figure 4: Figures showing how the weights within a single weight matrix W ∈R6×5 for a linear layer would be partitioned. D S CALABILITY In the paper, we claim that our method is scalable compared to Schw¨obel et al. (2021) and Immer et al. (2022). What constraints the scalability of the mentioned prior works, however, is different. For the Last Layer Marginal Likelihood, although the approach works on small datasets such as PCAM (Veeling et al., 2018) and MNIST, the authors report that they were unable to learn invariances 15Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 on larger datasets such as CIFAR10. In (Schw¨obel et al., 2021, section 7), they explore the issue of scalability in more detail, and showcase that last layer marginal likelihood is insufﬁcient. Differentiable Laplace performs well, even on more complex datasets, such as CIFAR10. Their scalability, however, is limited by the computational and memory complexity of their method, which we go into in more detail in the section below. D.1 C OMPLEXITY ANALYSIS First, we consider the scalability of our algorithm in terms of computational and memory complexity. In particular, we show that our method scales much more favourably compared to Differentiable Laplace (Immer et al., 2022). We present our analysis for a feed-forward model of depth L, with layer widths D8. In order to directly compare to Immer et al. (2022) and Benton et al. (2020), we consider the complexities in the invariance learning setup (Benton et al., 2020; van der Wilk et al., 2018) withSaugmentation samples. In other experiments, hyperparameter optimization setups, S can be taken to be 1. The notation is summarized in Table 5. N Number of datapoints in dataset D NB Batch size S Number of augmentation samples9 C Output size (number of classes) D Feedforward network layer widths L Feedforward network depth P Number of parameters (s.t. O(P) =O(LD2 + DC)) Table 5: Notation for complexity analysis. We consider the computational and memory costs of 1) obtaining a gradient with respect to the parameters 2) obtaining a gradient with respect to the hyperparameters, and 3) computing the value of the model/hyperparameter selection objective for each method. All analysis assumes computation on a Monte-Carlo estimate of the objective on a single batch of data. In Tables 6 and 7, we assume that C <D, and hence, for the clarity of comparison, sometimes fold a factor depending Cinto a factor depending on Dif it’s clearly smaller. This hiding of the factors was only done for Differentiable Laplace, which is the worst scaling method. D.1.1 C OMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY Param. Backward Hyperparam. Backward Hyperparam.

The two terms highlighted for Augerino can be computed in a single backward pass. For Differentiable Laplace, the terms in blue can be amortised over multiple hyperparameter backward passes. That is why, in their method, they propose updating the hyperparameters once every epoch on (possibly) multiple batches of data, rather than once on every batch as is done with Partitioned Networks and Augerino. 8This is for the ease of comparison. Same upper bound complexities will hold for a network of variable sizes Dℓ for ℓ∈[L], where D= maxℓ Dℓ 9Only relevant for invariance learning. 16Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 D.1.2 M EMORY COMPLEXITY The memory complexities for Partitioned Networks, Augerino, and Differentiable Laplace are shown in Table 7. Crucially, the memory required to update the hyperparameters for Differentiable Laplace scales as O(NBSLD2 + P), with a term depending on the square of the network widths. This can become prohibitively expensive for larger models, and is likely the reason why their paper only considers experiments on architectures with widths up to a maximum of 256. Param.

D.2 P RACTICAL SCALABILITY A complexity analysis in big- Onotation as provided by us in the previous sections allows to understand scalability in the limit, but constant terms that manifest in practice are still of interest. In this section we aim present real timing measurements for our method in comparison to Augerino and Differential Laplace, and elaborate on what overhead might be expected with respect to standard neural network training. The empirical timings measurements on an NVIDIA RTX 3080-10GB GPU are shown in Table 8. We used a batch-size of 250, 200 for the MNIST and CIFAR10 experiments respectively, and 20 augmentation samples, just like in our main experiments in Table 1 and Figure 3. As can be seen, the overhead from using a partitioned network is fairly negligible compared to a standard forward and backward pass. The one difference compared to Augerino is, however, the fact that a separate forward-backward pass needs to be made to update the hyperparameters and regular parameters. This necessity is something that can be side-stepped with alternative partitioning schemes, as preliminarily mentioned in appendix C, and is an interesting direction for future research.

On the ResNet-14, we get an out-of- memory error during the hyperparam. update step with Differentiable Laplace on the NVIDIA RTX 3080-10GB GPU when running with the ofﬁcial codebase (Immer and van der Ouderaa). Memory Overhead Our proposed method’s memory consumption scales in the same way as Augerino or vanilla neural network training. There is a minor constant memory overhead due to having to store the assignment of weights to partitions. In general, only log Cbits per parameter are necessary to store the partition assignments, whereCis the number of chunks. In our implementation, we only consider C <28, and hence store the assignments in byte tensors. This means that the partitioned models require extra 25% memory for storing the parameters (when using 32bit ﬂoats to represent the parameters). 17Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 If the “default” weight values (i.e. those denoted ˆwi in Figure 1) are non-zero, there is an additional overhead to storing those as well, which doubles the memory required to store the parameters. We observed there was no difference in performance when setting default weight values to 0 in architectures in which normalisation layers are used (i.e. most modern architectures). As such, we would in general recommend to set the default weight values to 0. However, we found setting default values to the initialised values to be necessary for stability of training deep normalisation-free architectures such as the ﬁxup architectures (Zhang et al., 2019) we used to compare with Differentiable Laplace. As their method is not compatible with BatchNorm, we used these architectures in our experiments, and hence used non-zero default values. Lastly, if the default weight values are set to the (random) initialisation values, it is possible to write a cleverer implementation in which only the random seeds are stored in memory, and the default values are re-generated every time they are need in a forward and a backward pass. This would make the memory overhead from storing the default values negligible. E N OTE ON AUGERINO In replicating Augerino (Benton et al., 2020) within our code-base and experimenting with the implementation, we discovered a pathological behaviour that is partly mirrored by the authors of Immer et al. (2022). In particular, note that the loss function (Benton et al., 2020, Equation (5)) proposed by the authors is problematic in the sense that for any regularization strength λ> 0, the optimal loss value is negative inﬁnity since the regularization term (negative L2-norm) is unbounded. In our experiments we observe that for a sufﬁciently-large value of λand after a sufﬁcient number of iterations, this behaviour indeed appears and training diverges. In practice, using Augerino therefore necessitates either careful tuning of λ, clipping the regularisation term (a method that introduces yet another hyperparameter), or other techniques such as early stopping. In the open-source repository for the submission (Benton et al.), it can be seen that on many experiments the authors use a ”safe” variant of the objective, in which they clip the regulariser (without pass-through of the gradient) once the l∞-norm of any of the hyperparameters becomes larger than an arbitrary threshold. Without using this adjustment, we found that the Augerino experiments on MNIST crashed every time with hyperparameters diverging to inﬁnity.

Partitioned networks allow for learning hyperparameters in a single training run, however, they introduce an additional hyperparameter in doing so: the partitioning scheme. The practitioner needs to choose the number of chunks C, the relative proportions of data in each chunk, and the relative proportions of parameters assigned to each of the Cpartitions wk. We investigate the sensitivity to the partitioning scheme here. We show that our results are fairly robust to partitioning through a grid-search over parameter partitions and chunk proportions on the afﬁne augmentation learning task on MNIST with the CNN architecture we use throughout this work. 18Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 (a) 2 chunks [8,1] [4,1] [1,1] [1,4] [1,8] Param.

Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the test accuracy for a choice of chunk and parameter proportions across two, three and four chunks. The proportions are to be read as un-normalized distributions; for example, chunk proportions set to [1,8] denotes that there are 8×as many datapoints assigned to the second compared to the ﬁrst. Each conﬁguration was run with 2 random seeds, and we report the mean across those runs in the ﬁgure. The same architecture used was the same as for the main MNIST experiments in section 5 (see Appendix I.4 for details). We observe that for various partition/dataset-chunking conﬁgurations, all models achieve fairly similar ﬁnal test accuracy. There is a trend for models with a lot of parameters assigned to later chunks, but with few datapoints assigned to later chunks, to perform worse. While these results show a high level of robustness against the choice of additional hyperparameters introduced by our method, these results do show an opportunity or necessity for choosing the right partitioning scheme in order to achieve optimal performance. F.2 S ENSITIVITY IN TERMS OF HYPERPARAMETERS FOUND To compare how the different partitioning schemes qualitatively impact the hyperparameters that the method identiﬁes, we also retrain vanilla models from scratch using the hyperparameter values found using partitioned networks. Namely, we take the ﬁnal value of the hyperparameters learned with partitioned networks with a given partitioning scheme, and plot the ﬁnal test set accuracy of a vanilla neural network model trained from scratch with those hyperparameters.

To validate this claim, we conducted a fairly extensive hyperparameter search on the afﬁne augmentation learning task on RotMNIST; we trained 200 models by ﬁrst sampling a set of afﬁne augmentation parameters uniformly at random from a predeﬁned range 10, and then training a neural network model (that averages across augmentation samples at train and test time, as described in Benton et al. (2020)) with standard neural training with those hyperparameters ﬁxed throughout. In Figure 9, we plot the ﬁnal test-set performance of all the models trained with those hyperparameters sampled from a ﬁxed range. Alongside, we show the hyperparameters and test-set performance of the partitioned networks as they progress throughout training. The partitioned networks consistently achieve ﬁnal test-set performance as good as that of the best hyperparameter conﬁgurations iden- tiﬁed through extensive random sampling of the space. We also show the test-set performance of neural network models, trained through standard training, with hyperparameters ﬁxed to the ﬁnal hyperparameter values identiﬁed by the partitioned networks. The hyperparameters identiﬁed by partitioned networks appear to also be good for regular neural networks; the standard neural networks with hyperparameters identiﬁed through partitioned training also outperform the extensive random sampling of the hyperparameter space. Furthermore, Figure 9 shows that partitioned networks do learn full rotation invariance on the RotMNIST task, i.e. when full rotation invariance is present in the data generating distribution. 0.0 0.2 0.4 Translation X 0.96 0.97 0.98 0.99T est Accuracy 0.0 0.2 0.4 Translation Y 0 /2 Rotation Random Sampling Partitioned Runs Partitioned Runs Final Partitioned Runs Final - Retrained 0.0 0.2 0.4 Scale X 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Scale Y 0.0 0.2 0.4 Shear Figure 9: The test-set performance plotted alongside (1D projections of) afﬁne augmentation hyper- parameters on the RotMNIST task with MNIST-CNN.

Complexity Inherent to our method — as presented in e.g. Figure 1 — is the necessity for an additional forward-backward pass to update the hyperparameters. Consequently, hyperparameter optimization has additional costs which, however, are signiﬁcantly less than the computational costs of existing work, as we discuss in more detail in Appendix D.1 and the experimental section. Furthermore, empirically, partitioned networks usually require more training iterations to converge. Performance Assuming the optimal hyper-parameters are given, training the full, non-partitioned networks based on those optimal values can be expected to yield better performance compared to the ﬁnal model found by partitioned training. Partitioning the network inherently constrains the network capacity, causing some loss of performance. Opportunities for alleviating this performance loss while still enjoying single-run hyperparameter optimization through partitioned training will be left to future work. These include for example adjusting training rounds or increasing network capacity in the ﬁrst place. Partitioning While partitioned networks allows for automatic optimization of, intuitively, hard to tune hyperparameters, such as augmentation parameters, they come with the additional limitation of requiring to partition both the data and the model. This introduces an additional hyperparameter, namely, the partitioning strategy. While our default strategy of assigning more parameters and data to the ﬁrst chunk works reasonably well on all of the experiments we consider, if one targets obtaining the best possible performance on a given task, the partitioning strategy might need additional tuning. We provide some empirical results about the sensitivity to partitioning in appendix F.1 I E XPERIMENTAL DETAILS I.1 P ARTITIONED TRAINING Partitioned parameter update scheduling The gradient computation of Equation 3, as described in the main text, requires that the data-points for updating a given subnetwork w(k) s come from the appropriate dataset chunks (x,y) ∈D1:k for a chunk k. Depending on the partitioning scheme (Appendix C), evaluating different subnetworks for different chunks can or cannot be done in a single mini-batch. More speciﬁcally, the random weight-partitioning we chose for our experiments requires a separate mini-batch per subnetwork (in order to keep the memory cost the same as for standard neural network training). An immediate question arising from a chunked dataset and several partitions is to deﬁne the order and frequency of updates across subnetworks. In our experiments we deﬁne (non-uniform) splits of the training dataset Dacross the Cchunks, which requires a tailored approach to sampling the data. More speciﬁcally, for a given (normalized) ratio of chunk-sizes [u1,...,u C], each iteration of partitioned training proceeds as follows: 1. Sample a partition index k∼Cat(u1,...,u C) 2. Sample a mini-batch ˜Dof examples uniformly from D1:k. 3. Evaluate log p( ˜D|w(k) s ,ψ) using subnetwork w(k) s and 4. compute the (stochastic) gradient wrt. partition parameters wk (Eq. 3). 5. Update partition parameters wk using an optimizer, such as SGD or Adam. This sampling scheme results in a data-point (x,y) ∈Dk from earlier chunks to be sampled more often. Concretely, the probability that an example in chunk kwill be sampled is ∝∑ i≤kui. This is done so that each partition wk is updated with equal probability on each of the examples in D1:k As a result, we use with replacement sampling for the partitioned network training throughout the experimental section. 21Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Gradient optimization of partitioned parameters A consequence of per-partition updates with the random weight partitioning scheme (appendix C) is that, for a chosen partition wk to update, all other partitions do not receive a gradient update. In other words, the gradient at each iteration is sparse. Consequently, many off-the-shelve momentum-based optimizers will not account correctly. Speciﬁcally, we implement modiﬁcations to the PyTorch Paszke et al. (2019) provided optimizers that allow us to track per-partition momenta, number of steps, etc. Note that this creates a disconnect between the number of iterations across all partitions and the number of iterations per-partition. Doing so, however aligns the computational cost of training the partitioned network parameters with the cost of training regular neural network parameters. Regardless, we do not alter the way learning-rate schedulers behave in our experiments and anneal learning-rates according to the total number of iterations. Similarly, we report the total number of iterations when comparing against baselines that update all network-parameters per iteration. While a simple gradient-accumulation scheme across mini-batches would result in a single gradient across all partitions, this approach inherently clashes with non-uniform partitioning [u1,...,u C]. Instead, we chose to sequentially apply gradients computed on a single partition, as described in the previous paragraphs. A further advantage of this approach is that learning progress made by updating partition wk immediately inﬂuences (and can improve) the prediction of subnetworks w(k) s ,w(k+1) s ,..., w(C) s . Gradient optimization of hyperparameters Our partitioned network scheme makes it easy to compute stochastic gradients of the hyperparameter objective LML in Eq. 4 using batch gradient descent optimization methods. After every update to a randomly sampled network partition (see previous paragraph), we update hyperparamters ψas follows: • sample a dataset chunk index k ∼Cat(u2 Z ,..., uC Z ). Ratios are re-normalized to exclude D1. • sample a mini-batch ˜Dof examples uniformly from Dk (Note the choice of Dk instead of D1:k). • Evaluate log p( ˜D|w(k−1) s ,ψ) using subnetwork w(k−1) s and • compute the (stochastic) gradient wrt. hyperparameters ψ(Eq. 4). • Update partition parameters ψusing an optimizer, such as SGD or Adam. The above sampling procedure yields an unbiased estimate of gradients in eq. 4. The fact that we optimize hyperparameters with gradients based on data from a single chunk at a time is again a consequence of the random weight-partitioning scheme for the partitioned networks. It is possible to compute gradients wrt. ψfor mini-batches with examples from multiple chunks at a time. With the random weight partitioning scheme, this would result in an increased memory overhead. Lastly, we could also accumulate gradients from different chunks, similarly to Immer et al. (2022), and this would likely result in a lower-variance estimate per update . It is also possible to reduce the computational overhead of evaluating two mini-batches per iteration (one for updates to wk, one for ψ) as we do in our experiments by interleaving hyperparameter updates at less frequent intervals. We leave an exploration of these design choices to future work. Throughout all experiments, except those in the federated settings (see section J), we use the same batch-size for the hyperparameter udpates as for the regular parameter updates. Weight-decay For partitioned networks, whenever using weight-decay, we scale the weight decay for earlier partitions with the reciprocal of the number of examples in chunks used to optimize them, following the diagonal Gaussian prior interpretation of weight-decay. This makes the training compatible with the variational interpretation in Appendix B. I.2 P ARTITIONED AFFINE TRANSFORMATIONS In Appendix C we described how we realize partitioned versions of fully-connected and convolutional layers. Design choices for other parameterized network layers used in our experiments are described below. 22Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Normalization layers It is common-place in most architectures to follow a normalization layer (such as BatchNorm (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), GroupNorm (Wu and He, 2018)) with an element- wise or channel-wise, afﬁne transformation. Namely, such a transformation multiplies its input h by a scale vector s and adds a bias vector b: o = h ∗s + b. For random weight-partitioned networks, we parameterize such afﬁne transformations by deﬁning separate vectors {s1,..., sC} and {b1,..., bC}for each partition; the actual scale and bias used in a given subnetwork w(k) s are s(k) s = ∏ i∈{1,...,k}si and b(k) s = ∑ i∈{1,...,k}bi respectively. This ensures that the ﬁnal afﬁne transformation for each subnetwork w(k) s depends on the parameters in the previous partitions [1,...,k −1]. Doing so increases the parameter count for the partitioned networks in architectures that use those normalization layers by a negligible amount. Scale and bias in FixUp networks The FixUp paper (Zhang et al., 2019) introduces extra scales and biases into the ResNet architecture that transform the entire output of the layers they follow. We turn these into “partitioned” parameters using the same scheme as that for scales and biases of afﬁne transformations following normalization layers. For partitioned networks, through-out the paper, we match the proportion of parameters assigned to each partition kin each layer to the proportion of data examples in the corresponding chunk Dk. I.3 A RCHITECTURE CHOICES Input selection experiments We use a fully-connected feed-forward neural network with2 hidden layers of size [256,256], and with GeLU (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) activation functions. We initialise the weights using the Kaiming uniform scheme (He et al., 2015). For partitioned networks, we use the random-weight partitioning scheme. Fixup Resnet For all experiments using FixUp ResNets we follow Immer et al. (2022); Zhang et al. (2019), and use a 3-stage ResNet with channel-sizes (16,32,64) per stage, with identity skip- connections for the residual blocks as described in He et al. (2016). The residual stages are followed by average pooling and a ﬁnal linear layer with biases. We use 2D average pooling in the residual branches of the downsampling blocks.We initialize all the parameters as described in Zhang et al. (2019). Wide ResNet For all experiments using a Wide-ResNet-N-D (Zagoruyko and Komodakis, 2016), with N being the depth and D the width multiplier, we use a 3 stage ResNet with channel-sizes (16D,32D,64D). We use identity skip-connections for the residual blocks, as described in He et al. (2016), also sometimes known as ResNetV2. ResNet-50 We use the ”V2” version of Wide ResNet as described in (Zagoruyko and Komodakis, 2016) and replace BatchNormalization with GroupNormalization using 2 groups. We use the ’standard’ with withD= 1and three stages of 8 layers for a 50-layer deep ResNet. We use ReLU activations for all ResNet experiments throughout. MNIST CNN For the MNIST experiments, we use the same architecture as Schw¨obel et al. (2021) illustrated in the replicated Table 9. Table 9: CNN architecture for MNIST experiments Layer Speciﬁcation 2D convolution channels=20, kernel size=(5,5), padding=2, activation=ReLU Max pooling pool size=(2,2), stride=2 2D convolution channels=50, kernel size=(5,5), padding=2, activation=ReLU Max pooling pool size=(2,2), stride=2 Fully connected units=500, activation=ReLU Fully connected units=50, activation=ReLU Fully connected units=10, activation=Softmax 23Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 I.4 T RAINING DETAILS Learning afﬁne augmentations For the parametrization of the learnable afﬁne augmentation strategies, we follow prior works for a fair comparison. More speciﬁcally, for our MNIST based setup we follow the parametrization proposed in Schw¨obel et al. (2021) whereas for our CIFAR10 based setup we use the generator parametrization from Immer et al. (2022). Input selection experiments For the model selection (non-differentiable) input selection exper- iments, we train all variants with Adam with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch-size of 256 for 10000 iterations. For both Laplace and partitioned networks, we do early stopping based on the marginal likelihood objective (LML for partitioned networks). We use weight-decay 0.0003 in both cases. For the post-hoc Laplace method, we use the diagonal Hessian approximation, following the recommendation in (Immer et al., 2021). For partitioned networks, we divide the data and parameters into 8 chunks of uniform sizes. We plot results averaged across 3 runs. Mask learning for input selection experiment We use the same optimizer settings as for the input selection experiment. We train for 30000 iterations, and optimize hyperparameters with Adam with a learning rate of 0.001. We divide the data and parameters into 4 uniform chunks. MNIST experiments We follow Schw¨obel et al. (2021), and optimize all methods with Adam with a learning rate of 0.001, no weight decay, and a batch-size of 200. For the partitioned net- works and Augerino results, we use 20 augmentation samples. We use an Adam optimizer for the hyperparameters with a learning rate of 0.001 (and default beta parameters). For Augerino on MNIST, we use the “safe” variant, as otherwise the hyperparameters and the loss diverge on every training run. We elaborate on this phenomenon in Appendix E. Otherwise, we follow the recommended settings from (Benton et al., 2020) and Immer et al. (2022), namely, a regularization strength of 0.01, and a learning rate for the hyperparameters of 0.05. For both MNIST and CIFAR experiments, we found it beneﬁcial to allocate more data to either the earlier, or the later, chunks. Hence, we use 3 chunks with [80%,10%,10%] split of examples for all MNIST and CIFAR experiments. CIFAR variations experiments We again follow Immer et al. (2022), and optimize all ResNet models with SGD with a learning rate of 0.1 decayed by a factor of 100×using Cosine An- nealing, and momentum of 0.9 (as is standard for ResNet models). We use a batch-size of 250. We again use Adam for hyperparameter optimization with a learning rate of 0.001 (and default beta parameters). We train our method for [2400,8000,12000,20000,40000] iterations on subsets [1000,5000,10000,20000,50000] respectively for CIFAR-10, just as in (Immer et al., 2022). For all methods, we used a weight-decay of 1e−4. For partitioned networks, we increase the weight decay for earlier partitions with the square root of the number of examples in chunks used to optimize them, following the diagonal Gaussian prior interpretation of weight-decay. We use3 chunks with [80%,10%,10%] split of examples. For RotCIFAR-10 results, we noticed our method hasn’t fully converged (based on training loss) in this number of iterations, and so we doubled the number of training iterations for the RotMNIST results. This slower convergence can be explained by the fact that, with our method, we only update a fraction of the network parameters at every iteration. TinyImagenet experiments Our experiments with TinyImagenet (Le and Yang, 2015) closely follow the setting for the CIFAR-10 experiments described above. Images are of size64x64 pixels, to be classiﬁed into one of 200 classes. The training-set consists of 100000 images and we compare our method against baselines on subset of [10000,50000,100000] datapoints. For the standard version of TinyImagenet, we train for [80000,80000,40000] steps respectively and for the rotated version of TinyImagenet we train for 120000 steps for all subset sizes. We tuned no other hyper-parameters compared to the CIFAR-10 setup and report our method’s result for a partitioning with[80%,20%] across 2 chunks after ﬁnding it to perform slightly better than a [80%,10%,10%] split across 3 chunks in a preliminary comparison. 24Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Fine-tuning experiments For the ﬁne-tuning experiments in table 2, we trained a FixUp ResNet-14 on a subset of 20000 CIFAR10 examples, while optimizing afﬁne augmentations (following afﬁne augmentations parameterization in (Benton et al., 2020)). We used the same optimizer settings as for all other CIFAR experiments, and trained for 80000 iterations, decaying the learning rate with Cosine Annealing for the ﬁrst 60000 iterations. For ﬁne-tuning of validation-set optimization models, we used SGD with same settings, overriding only the learning rate to 0.01. We tried a learning rate of 0.01 and 0.001, and selected the one that was most favourable for the baseline based on the test accuracy. We also tried training on the full CIFAR-10 dataset, but found that all methods ended up within a standard error of each other when more than 70% of the data was assigned to the ﬁrst chunk (or training set, in the case of validation set optimization). This indicates that CIFAR-10 is sufﬁciently larger that, when combined with afﬁne augmentation learning and the relatively small ResNet-14 architecture used, using the extra data in the 2nd partition (or the validation set) results in negligible gains. I.5 D ATASETS Input selection synthetic dataset For the input selection dataset, we sample 3000 datapoints for the training set as described in section 5, and we use a fresh sample of 1000 datapoints for the test set. RotMNIST Sometimes in the literature, RotMNIST referes to a speciﬁc subset of 12000 MNIST examples, whereas in other works, the full dataset with 60000 examples is used. In this work, following (Benton et al., 2020; Immer et al., 2022) we use the latter. J F EDERATED PARTITIONED TRAINING In this section, we explain how partitioned networks can be applied to the federated setting, as well as the experimental details. J.1 P ARTITIONED NETWORKS IN FL In order to apply partitioned networks to the federated setting, we randomly choose a partition for each client such that the marginal distribution of partitions follows a pre-determined ratio. A given chunk Dk therefore corresponds to the union of several clients’ datasets. Analogous to how “partitioned training” is discussed in the main text and Appendix I, we desire each partition wk to be updated on chunks D1:k. Equation 3 in the main text explains which data chunks are used to compute gradients wrt. parameter partition wk. An analogous perspective to this objective is visualized by the exemplary algorithm in Figure 1 and asks which partitions are inﬂuenced (i,e., updated) by data from chunk Dk: A data chunk Dk is used to compute gradients wrt. partitions wk:C through subnetworks w(k) s to w(C) s respectively. Consequently, a client whose dataset is assigned to chunkDk can compute gradients for all partitions wk:C. Updating network partitions Due to the weight-partitioned construction of the partitioned neural networks, it is not possible to compute gradients with respect to all partitions in a single batched forward-pass through the network. Additionally, a change to the partition parameters wk directly inﬂuences subnetworks w(k+1) s to w(C) s . In order to avoid the choice of ordering indices kto Cfor the client’s local update computation, we update each partition independently while keeping all other partitions initialised to the server-provided values that the client received in that round t: Denote Di,k as the dataset of client iwhere we keep index kto emphasize the client’s assignment to chunkk. Further denote wt+1 j,i as the partition wt j after having been updated by client ion dataset Di,k. wt+1 j,i = arg max wj log p ( Di,k|(wt 1,..., wt j, ˆwt j+1,..., ˆwt j+C),ψ ) ∀j ∈[k,C], (25) where the details of optimization are explained in the following section. We leave an explo- ration for different sequential updating schemes to future work. The ﬁnal update communi- cated by a client to the server consists of the concatenation of all updated parameter partitions 25Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 wt+1 .,i = concat(wt+1 k,i ,..., wt+1 C,i ). Note that partitions (wt 1,..., wt k−1) have not been modiﬁed and need not be communicated to the server. The resulting communication reductions make partitioned networks especially attractive to FL as data upload from client to server poses a signiﬁcant bottleneck. In practice, we expect the beneﬁts of these communication reductions to outweigh the additional computation burden of sequentially computing gradients wrt., to multiple partitions. The server receives wt+1 .,i from all clients that participates in round t, computes the delta’s with the global model and proceeds to average them to compute the server-side gradient in the typical federated learning fashion (Reddi et al., 2020). Updating hyperparameters The computation of gradients on a clientiwrt. ψis a straight-forward extension of equation 4 and the exemplary algorithm of Figure 1: ∇ψLML (Di,k,ψ) ≈∇ψlog p ( Di,k|w(t+1),(k−1) s,i ,ψ ) , (26) where Di,k corresponds to client i’s local dataset which is assigned to chunk k and w(t+1),(k−1) s corresponds to the (k−1)’th subnetwork after incorporating all updated partitionsw(t+1),(k−1) s,i = concat(wt 1,..., wt k−1,wt+1 k,i ,..., wt+1 C,i ). Note that we compute a full-batch update to ψin MNIST experiments and use a batch-size equal to the batch-size for the partitioned parameter updates for CIFAR10. Upon receiving these gradients from all clients in this round, the server averages them to form a server-side gradient. Conceptually, this approach to updating ψcorresponds to federated SGD. J.2 F EDERATED SETUP Non-i.i.d. partitioning For our federated experiments, we split the 50kMNIST and 45kCIFAR10 training data-points across 100 clients in a non-i.i.d. way to create the typical challenge to federated learning experiments. In order to simulate label-skew, we follow the recipe proposed in Reddi et al. (2020) with α= 1.0 for CIFAR10 and α= 0.1 for MNIST. Note that with α= 0.1, most clients have data corresponding to only a single digit. For our experiments on rotated versions of CIFAR10 and MNIST, we sample a degree of rotation per data-point and keep it ﬁxed during training. In order to create a non-i.i.d partitioning across the clients, we bin data-points according to their degree of rotation into 10 bins and sample using the same technique as for label-skew with α = 0.1 for both datasets. Learning curves are computed using the 10k MNIST and 5k CIFAR10 validation data-points respectively. For the rotated dataset experiments, we rotate the validation set in the same manner as the training set. Architectures and experimental setup We use the convolutional network provided at Schw¨obel et al. (2021) for MNIST and the ResNet-9 (Dys) model for CIFAR10 but with group normaliza- tion (Wu and He, 2018) instead of batch normalization. We include (learnable) dropout using the continuous relaxation proposed at Maddison et al. (2016) between layers for both architectures. We select 3 chunks for MNIST with a [0.7,0.2,0.1] ratio for both, client-assignments and parameter- partition sizes. For CIFAR10, we found a [0.9,0.1] split across 2 sub-networks to be beneﬁcial. In addition to dropout logits, ψencompasses parameters for afﬁne transformations, i.e., shear, trans- lation, scale and rotation. We report results after 2kand 5krounds, respectively, and the expected communication costs as a percentage of the non-partitioned baseline. Shared setting In order to elaborate on the details to reproduce our results, we ﬁrst focus on the settings that apply across all federated experiments. We randomly sample the corresponding subset of 1.25k, 5kdata-points from the full training set and keep that selection ﬁxed across experiments (i,e., baselines and partitioned networks) as well as seeds. The subsequent partitioning across clients as detailed in the previous paragraph is equally kept ﬁxed across experiments and seeds. Each client computes updates for one epoch of its local dataset, which, for the low data regimes of 1.25k data-points globally, results in single update per client using the entire local dataset. We averaged over 10 augmentation samples for the forward pass in both training and inference. MNIST & RotMNIST For 5k data-points and correspondingly 50 data-points on average per client, most clients perform a single update step. A small selection of clients with more than 64 data- 26Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 points performs two updates per round. For the experiments using the full dataset and a mini-batch size of 64, each client performs multiple updates per round. After initial exploration on the baseline FedAvg task, we select a local learning-rate of 5e−2 and apply standard SGD. The server performs Adam Reddi et al. (2020) with a learning rate of 1e−3 for the model parameters. We keep the other parameters of Adam at their standard PyTorch values. We ﬁnd this setting to generalize to the partitioned network experiments but found a higher learning rate of3e−3 for the hyper-parameters to be helpful. We chose the convolutional network from Schw¨obel et al. (2021) with (learned) dropout added between layers. The model’s dropout layers are initialized to drop10% of hidden activations. For the baseline model we keep the dropout-rate ﬁxed and found 10% to be more stable than 30%. CIFAR10 & RotCIFAR10 We ﬁx a mini-batch size of 32, leading to multiple updates per client per round in both, the full dataset regime as well as the5kdata-points setting. Similarly to the MNIST setting, we performed an initial exploration of hyperparameters on the baseline FedAvg task and use the same ones on partitioned networks. We used dropout on the middle layer of each block which was initialized to 0.1 for both the baseline and partitioned networks and whereas partitioned networks optimized it with LML and the concrete relaxation from Maddison et al. (2016), the baseline kept it ﬁxed. For the server side optimizer we used Adam with the default betas and a learning rate of 1e−2, whereas for the hyperparameters we used Adam with the default betas and a learning rate of 1e−3. In both cases we used an ϵ= 1e−7. For the local optimizer we used SGD with a learning rate of 10−0.5 and no momentum. J.3 MNIST LEARNING CURVES In Figure 10 we show learning curves for the three considered dataset sizes on the standard MNIST task. Each learning curve is created by computing a moving average across 10 evaluations, each of which is performed every 10 communication rounds, for each seed. We then compute the average and standard-error across sees and plot those values on the y-axis. On the x-axis we denote the total communication costs (up- and download) to showcase the partitioned networks reduction in communication overhead. We see that especially for the low dataset regime, training has not converged yet and we expect performance to improve for an increased number of iterations.

However, we often do not know a priori what invariances are present in the data, or to what extent a model should be invariant to a given symmetry group. We show how tolearn invariances and equivariances by parameterizing a distribution over augmentations and optimizing the training loss simultaneously with respect to the network parameters and augmentation parameters. With this simple procedure we can recover the correct set and extent of invariances on image classiﬁcation, regression, segmentation, and molecular property prediction from a large space of augmentations, on training data alone. 1 Introduction The ability to learn constraints or symmetries is a foundational property of intelligent systems. Humans are able to discover patterns and regularities in data that provide compressed representations of reality, such as translation, rotation, intensity, or scale symmetries. Indeed, we see the value of such constraints in deep learning. Fully connected networks are more ﬂexible than convolutional networks, but convolutional networks are more broadly impactful because they enforce thetranslation equivariance symmetry: when we translate an image, the outputs of a convolutional layer translate in the same way [24, 7]. Further gains have been achieved by recent work hard-coding additional symmetries, such as rotation equivariance, into convolutional neural networks [e.g., 7, 41, 44, 31] But we might wonder whether it is possible to learn that we want to use a convolutional neural network. Moreover, we typically do not know which constraints are suitable for a given problem, and to what extent those constraints should be enforced. The class label for the digit ‘6’ is rotationally invariant up until it becomes a ‘9’. Like biological systems, we would like to automatically discover the appropriate symmetries. This task appears daunting, because standard learning objectives such as maximum likelihood select for ﬂexibility, rather than constraints [29, 32]. In this paper, we provide an extremely simple and practical approach to automatically discovering invariances and equivariances, from training data alone . Our approach operates by learning a distribution over augmentations, then training with augmented data, leading to the name Augerino. Augerino (1) can learn both invariances and equivariances over a wide range of symmetry groups, including translations, rotations, scalings, and shears; (2) can discover partial symmetries, such as rotations not spanning the full range from [−π,π]; (3) can be combined with any standard architectures, loss functions, or optimization algorithm with little overhead; (4) performs well on regression, classiﬁcation, and segmentation tasks, for both image and molecular data. To our knowledge, Augerino is the ﬁrst approach that can learn symmetries in neural networks from training data alone, without requiring a validation set or a special loss function. In Sections 3-5 we introduce Augerino and show why it works. The accompanying code can be found at https://github.com/g-benton/learning-invariances. 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada. arXiv:2010.11882v2  [cs.LG]  1 Dec 20202 Related Work There is a large body of work constructing convolutional neural networks that have hard-coded invariance or equivariance to a set of transformations, such as rotation [ 7, 41, 44, 31] and scaling [40, 36]. While recent methods use a representation theoretic approach to ﬁnd a basis of equivariant convolutional kernels [9, 41, 39], the older method of Laptev et al. [22] pools network outputs over many hard-coded transformations of the input for ﬁxed invariances, but does not consider equivariances or learning the transformations. van der Wilk et al. [38] learn transformations for learning invariances in kernel methods from training data, using the marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process. The marginal likelihood, which is the integral of the product of the likelihood with a parameter prior, automatically selects for constraints [e.g., 29]. They propose a similar pipeline of learning the parameters of a transformation directly by backpropagation and the reparametrization trick. In contrast to their work, we develop a framework that can be easily applied to deep neural networks with standard loss functions, without needing to compute a marginal likelihood (which is typically intractable). Our framework can also learn more general transformations through the exponential map, as well as equivariant models. With a desire to automate the machine learning pipeline, Cubuk et al.[10] introduced AutoAugment in which reinforcement learning is used to ﬁnd an optimal augmentation policy within a discrete search space. At the expense of a massive computational budget for the search, AutoAugment brought substantial gains in image classiﬁcation performance, including state-of-the-art results on ImageNet. The AutoAugment framework was extended ﬁrst to Fast AutoAugment in Lim et al. [27], improving both the speed and accuracy of AutoAugment by using Bayesian data augmentation [ 37]. Both Cubuk et al. [10] and Lim et al. [27] apply a reinforcement learning approach to searching the space of augmentations, signiﬁcantly differing from our work which directly optimizes distributions over augmentations with respect to the training loss. Faster AutoAugment [15], which uses a GAN framework to match augmentations to the data distri- bution, and Differentiable Automatic Data Augmentation [25] which applies a DARTS [28] bi-level optimization procedure to learn augmentation from the validation loss are most similar to Augerino in the discovery of distributions over augmentations. Both methods learn augmentations from data using the reparametrization trick; however unlike Li et al. [25] and Liu et al. [28], we learn augmentations directly from the training loss without need for GAN training or the complex DARTS procedure [28, 42, 26], and are speciﬁcally learning degrees of invariances and equivariances. To the best of our knowledge, Augerino is the ﬁrst work to learn invariances and equivariances in neural networks from training data alone. The ability to automatically discover symmetries enables us to uncover interpretable salient structure in data, and provide better generalization. 3 Augerino: Learning Invariances through Augmentation A simple way of constructing a model invariant to a given group of transformations is to average the outputs of an arbitrary model for the inputs transformed with all the transformations in the group. For example, if we wish to make a given image classiﬁer invariant to horizontal reﬂections, we can average the predictions of the network for the original and reﬂected input. Augerino functions by sampling multiple augmentations from a parametrized distribution then applying these augmentations to an input to acquire multiple augmented samples of the input. The augmented input samples are each then passed through the model, with the ﬁnal prediction being generated by averaging over the individual outputs. We present the Augerino framework in Figure 1. Now, suppose we are working with a set Sof transformations. Relevant transformations may not always form a group structure, such as rotations Rφ by limited angles in the range φ ∈[−θ,θ]. Given a neural network fw, with parameters w, we can make a new model ¯f which is approximately invariant to transformations Sby averaging the outputs over a uniform distribution µθ(·) over the transformations g∈Swith supp(µθ) = S1 [e.g., 22, 34, 38] : ¯f(x) = Eg∼µθf(gx). (1) 1See Appendix A for further discussion on forming the invariant model. 2Figure 1: The Augerino framework. Augmentations are sampled from a distribution governed by parameters θ, and applied to an input to produce multiple augmented inputs. These augmented inputs are then passed to a neural network with weights w, and the ﬁnal prediction is generated by averaging over the multiple outputs. Augerino discovers invariances by learning θfrom training data alone. Since the cross-entropy loss ℓfor classiﬁcation is linear in the class log probabilities, we can pull the expectation outside of the loss: ℓ( ¯f(x)) = ℓ(Eg∼µθf(gx)) = Eg∼µθℓ(f(gx)). (2) As stochastic gradient descent only requires an unbiased estimator of the gradients, we can train the augmentation averaged model ¯f exactly by minimizing the loss of f(gx) averaged over a ﬁnite number of samples from g∼µθ at training time, using a Monte Carlo estimator. To learn the invariances we can also backpropagate through to the parameters θof the distribution µθ by using the reparametrization trick [20]. For example, for a uniform distribution over rotations with angles U[−θ,θ], we can parametrize the rotation angle by φ= θϵwith ϵ∼U[−1,1]. The loss L(·) for the augmentation-averaged model on an input xcan be computed as Lx(θ,w) = Eφ∼U[−θ,θ]ℓ ( fw(Rφx) ) = Eϵ∼U[−1,1]ℓ ( fw(Rϵθx) ) . (3) Speciﬁcally, during training we can use a single sample from the augmentation distribution to estimate the gradients. The learned range of rotations [−θ,θ] would correspond to the extent rotational invariance is present in the data. With a more general set ofktransformations, we can similarly deﬁne a distribution µθ(·) over the transformation elements using the reparametrization trickg= gϵ = ϵ⊙θ, with ϵ∼U[−1,1]k and θ∈Rk. The reparametrized loss is then Lx(θ,w) = Eϵ∼U[−1,1]kℓ ( fw(gϵx) ) . (4) In Section 3.2 we describe a parameterization of the set of afﬁne transformations which includes translations, rotations, and scalings of the input as special cases. In this fashion, we can train both the parameters of the augmentation averaged model ¯f consisting both of the weights wof fw and the parameters θof the augmentation distribution µθ. Test-time Augmentation At test time we sample multiple transformations g ∼µθ and make a prediction by averaging over the predictions generated for each transformed input, approximating the expectation in Equation (1). We further discuss train and test time augmentation in Appendix D. Regularized Loss Invariances correspond to constraints on the model, and in general the most unconstrained model may be able to achieve the lowest training loss. However, we have a prior belief that a model should preserve some level of invariance, even if standard losses cannot account for this preference. To bias training towards solutions that incorporate invariances, we add a regularization penalty to the network loss function that promotes broader distributions over augmentations. Our ﬁnal loss function is given by Lx(θ,w) = Eg∼µθℓ ( fw(gx) ) + λR(θ), (5) where Ris a regularization function encouraging coverage of a larger volume of transformations and λis the regularization weight (the form of R(θ) is discussed in Section 3.2). In practice we ﬁnd that the choice of λis largely unimportant; the insensitivity to the choice of λis demonstrated throughout Sections 4 and 6 in which performance is consistent for various values of λ. This is due to the fact that there is essentially no gradient signal for θover the range of augmentations consistent with the 3data, so even a small push is sufﬁcient. We discuss further why Augerino is able to learn the correct level of invariance — without sensitivity to λ, and from training data alone — in Section 5. We refer to the introduced method as Augerino. We summarize the method in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: Learning Invariances with Augerino Inputs: Dataset D; parametric family gof data augmentations and a distribution µθ over the parameters θ; neural network fw with parameters w; number ncopies of augmented inputs to use during training; number of training steps N. for i= 1,...,N do Sample a mini-batch ˜xfrom D; For each datapoint in ˜xsample ncopies transformations from µθ; Average predictions of the network fw over ncopies data transformations of ˜x; Compute the loss (5), L˜x(θ,w) using the averaged predictions; Take the gradient step to update the parameters wand θ; end 3.1 Extension to Equivariant Predictions We now generalize Augerino to problems where the targets are equivariant rather than invariant to a certain set of transformations. We say that target values are equivariant to a set of input transformations if the targets for a transformed input are transformed in the same way as the input. Formally, a function f is equivariant to a symmetry transformation g, if applying gto the input of the function is the same as applying gto the output, such that f(gx) = gf(x). For example, in image segmentation if the input image is rotated the target segmentation mask should also be rotated by the same angle, rather than being unchanged. To make the Augerino model equivariant to transformations sampled from µθ(·), we can average the inversely transformed outputs of the network for transformed inputs: faug-eq(x) = Eg∼µθg−1f(gx). (6) Supposing that gacts linearly on the image then the model is equivariant: faug-eq(hx) = Eg∼µθg−1f(ghx) = Eg∼µθh(gh)−1f(ghx) = hEu∼µθu−1f(ux) (7) = hfaug-eq(x) (8) where u= ghand the distribution is right invariant: for any measurable set S, ∀h∈G: µθ(S) = µθ(hS). If the distribution over the transformations is uniform then the model is equivariant. 3.2 Parameterizing Afﬁne Transformations We now show how to parametrize a distribution over the set of afﬁne transformations of 2ddata (e.g. images). With this parameterization, Augerino can learn from a broad variety of augmentations including translations, rotations, scalings and shears. The set of afﬁne transformations form an algebraic structure known as a Lie Group. To apply the reparametrization trick, we can parametrize elements of this Lie Group in terms of its Lie Algebra via the exponential map [13]. With a very simple approach, we can deﬁne bounds θi on a uniform distribution over the different exponential generators Gi in the Lie Algebra: gϵ = exp (∑ i ϵiθiGi ) ϵ∼U[−1,1]k, (9) where exp is the matrix exponential function: exp(A) = ∑∞ n=0 1 n! An. 2 The generators of the afﬁne transformations in 2d, G1,...,G 6, correspond to translation in x, translation in y, rotation, scaling in x, scaling in y, and shearing; we write out these generators in 2Mathematically speaking, this distribution is a pushforward by the exp map of a scaled cube with side lengths θi of a cube µθ(·) =exp∗Cubeθ(·). 4Data Samples -  - /2  0 /2 Rotation 0 1 2 3Probability No Reg.

Center: The initial and learned distributions over rotations. Right: The prediction probabilities of the correct class label over rotated versions of an image; the model learns to be approximately invariant to rotations under all levels of regularization. Appendix B. The exponential map of each generating matrix produces an afﬁne matrix that can be used to transform the coordinate grid points of the input like in Jaderberg et al. [18]. To ensure that the parameters θi are positive, we learn parameters ˜θi where θi = log(1 + exp ˜θi). In maximizing the volume of transformations covered, it would be geometrically sensible to maximize the Haar measure µH(S) of the set of transformations S = exp(Cubeθ) that are covered by Augerino, which is similar to the volume covered in the Lie Algebra Vol(Cubeθ) = Πk i=1θi. However, we ﬁnd that even the negative L2 regularization R(θ) = −∥θ∥2 on the bounds θi is sufﬁcient to bias the model towards invariance. More intuitively, the regularization penalty biases solutions towards values ofθ which induce broad distributions over afﬁne transformations, µθ. We apply the L2 regularization penalty on both classiﬁcation and regression problems, using cross en- tropy and mean squared error loss, respectively. This regularization method is effective, interpretable, and leads to the discovery of the correct level of invariance for a wide range ofλ. 4 Shades of Invariance We can broadly classify invariances in three distinct ways: ﬁrst there are cases in which we wish to be completely invariant to transformations in the data, such as to rotations on the rotMNIST dataset. There are also cases in which we want to be only partially invariant to transformations, i.e. soft invariance, such as if we are asking if a picture is right side up or upside down. Lastly, there are cases in which we wish there to be no invariance to transformations, such as when we wish to predict the rotations themselves. We show that Augerino can learn full invariance, soft invariance, and no invariance to rotations. We then explain in Section 5 why Augerino is able to discover the correct level of invariance from training data alone. Incidentally, soft invariances are the most representative of real-world problems, and also the most difﬁcult to correctly encode a priori — where we most need to learn invariances. For the experiments in this and all following sections we use a 13-layer CNN architecture from Laine and Aila [21]. We compare Augerino trained with three values of λfrom Equation 5; λ = {0.01,0.05,0.1}corresponding to low, standard, and high levels of regularization. To further emphasize the need for invariance to be learned as opposed to just embedded in a model we also show predictions generated from an invariant E(2)-steerable network [9]. Speciﬁc experimental and training details are in Appendix D. 4.1 Full Rotational Invariance: rotMNIST The rotated MNIST dataset (rotMNIST) consists of the MNIST dataset with the input images randomly rotated. As the dataset has an inherent augmentation present (random rotations), we desire a model that is invariant to such augmentations. With Augerino, we aim to approximate invariance to rotations by learning an augmentation distribution that is uniform over all rotations in [0,2π]. Figure 2 shows the learned distribution over rotations to apply to images input into the model. On top of learning the correct augmentation through automatic differentiation usingonly the training data, we achieve 98.9% test accuracy. We also see the level of regularization has little effect on performance. 5Original  Label 0  Label 1 Original  Label 2  Label 3 - /2  - /4  0 /4  /2 Rotation 0 1 2 3Probability Low Reg Mid.

Center: The initialized and learned distributions over rotations. Right: The predictions generated as an input is rotated. Here we see that there is no invariance present for any level of regularization - as the image rotates the predicted label changes accordingly. The E2-steerable network fails for this task, as the invariance to rotations prevents us from being able to predict the rotation of the image. To our knowledge, only Weiler and Cesa[39] achieve better performance on the rotMNIST dataset, using the correct equivariance already hard-coded into the network. 4.2 Soft Invariance: Mario & Iggy We show that Augerino can learnsoft invariances — e.g. invariance to a subset of transformations such as only partial rotations. To this end, we consider a dataset in which the labels are dependent on both image and pose. We use the sprites for the characters Mario and Iggy from Super Mario World, randomly rotated in the intervals of [−π/4,π/4] and [−π,−3π/4] ∪[3π/4,π] [33]. There are 4 labels in the dataset, one for the Mario sprite in the upper half plane, one for the Mario sprite in the lower half plane, one for the Iggy sprite in the upper half plane, and one for the Iggy sprite in the lower half plane; we show an example demonstrating each potential label in Figure 3. In Figure 3, the limited rotations present in the data give that the labels are invariant to rotations of up to π/4 radians. Augerino learns the correct augmentation distribution, and the predicted labels follow the desired invariances to rotations in [−π/4,π/4]. 4.3 Avoiding Invariance: Olivetti Faces To test that Augerino can avoid unwanted invariances we train the model on the rotated Olivetti faces dataset [16]. This dataset consists of 10 distinct images of 40 different people. We select the images of 30 people to generate the training set, randomly rotating each image in [−π/2,π/2], retaining the angle of rotation as the new label. We then crop the result to 45 ×45 pixel square images. We repeat the process 30 times for each image, generating 9000 training images.

(b): Loss value as a function of the rotation range applied to the input on the Mario and Iggy classiﬁcation problem of Section 4.2 and its derivative. Without regularization the loss is ﬂat for augmentations within the range [0,π/2] corresponding to the true rotational invariance range in the data, and grows sharply beyond this range. data generating process and the corresponding label. Augmenting the image with any rotation would make it impossible to learn the angle by which the original image was rotated. We ﬁnd experimentally in Figure 4 that when we initialize the Augerino model such that the distri- bution over the rotation generating matrix G3 is uniform [0,1], training for 200 epochs reduces the distribution on the rotational augmentation to have domain of support 0.003 radians wide. The model learns a nearly ﬁxed transformation in each of the 5 other spaces of afﬁne transformation, all with domains of support for the weights wi under 0.1 units wide. 5 Why Augerino Works The conventional wisdom is that it is impossible to learn invariances directly from the training loss as invariances are constraints on the model which make it harder to ﬁt the data. Given data that has invariance to some augmentation, the training loss will not be improved by widening our distribution over this augmentation, even if it helps generalization: we would want a model to be invariant to rotations of a ‘6’ up until it looks more like a ‘9’, but no invariance will achieve the same training loss. However, it is sufﬁcient to add a simple regularization term to encourage the model to discover invariances. In practice we ﬁnd that the ﬁnal distribution over augmentations is insensitive to the level of regularization, and that even a small amount of regularization will enable Augerino to ﬁnd wide distributions over augmentations that are consistent with the precise level of invariances in the data. We illustrate the learning of invariances with Augerino in panel (a) of Figure 5. Suppose only a limited degree of invariance is present in the data, as in Section 4.2. Then the training loss for the augmentation parameters will be ﬂat for augmentations within the range of invariance present in the data (shown in white), and then will increase sharply beyond this range (corresponding region of Augerino parameters is shown in blue). The regularized loss in Eq. (5) will push the model to increase the level of invariance within the ﬂat region of the training loss, but will not push it beyond the degree of invariance present in the data unless the regularization strength is extreme. We demonstrate the effect described above for the Mario and Iggy classiﬁcation problem of Section 4.2 in panel (b) of Figure 5. We use a network trained with Augerino and visualize the loss and gradient with respect to the range of rotations applied to the input with and without regularization. Without regularization, the loss is almost completely ﬂat until the value of π/2 which is the true degree of rotational invariance in the data. With regularization we add an incentive for the model to learn larger values of the rotation range. Consequently, the loss achieves its optimum close to the optimal value of the parameter at π/2 and then quickly grows beyond that value. Figure 6 displays the results of panel (b) of Figure 5 in action; gradient signals push augmentation distributions that are too wide down and too narrow up to the correct width. Incidentally, the Augerino solutions are substantially ﬂatter than those obtained by standard training, as shown in Appendix G, Figure 9, which may also make them more easily discoverable by procedures such as SGD. We also see that these solutions indeed provide better generalization. We provide further discussion of learning partial invariances with Augerino in Appendix A. 7Iteration -3 /4 - /2 - /4 0 /4 /2 -3 /4 Rotation Width Figure 6: The distribution over rotation augmentations for the Mario and Iggy dataset over training iterations for various initializations. Regardless of whether we start with too wide, too narrow, or approximately the correct distribution over rotations, Augerino converges to the appropriate width. 6 Image Recognition As Augerino learns a set of augmentations speciﬁc to a given dataset, we expect to see that Augerino is capable of boosting performance over applying any level of ﬁxed augmentation. Using the CIFAR-10 dataset, we compare Augerino to training on data with i) no augmentation, ii) ﬁxed, commonly applied augmentations, and iii) the augmentations as given by Fast AutoAugment Lim et al. [27]. Table 1: Test accuracy for models trained on CIFAR-10 with different augmentations applied to the training data. No Aug. Fixed Aug. Augerino ( 4 copies) Augerino ( 1 copy) Fast AA Test Accuracy 90.60 92 .64 93.81 ± 0.002 92 .22 ± 0.002 92 .65 We compare models trained with no augmentation, a ﬁxed commonly applied set of augmentations (including ﬂipping, cropping, and color-standardization), Augerino, and Fast AutoAugment [ 27]. Augerino with ncopies = 4 provides a boost in performance with minimal increased training time. Error bars are reported as the standard deviation in accuracy for Augerino trained over 10 trials. Table 1 shows that Augerino is competitive with advanced models that seek data-based augmentation schemes. The gains in performance are accompanied by notable simpliﬁcations in setup: we do not require a validation set and the augmentation is learned concurrently with training (there is no pre-processing to search for an augmentation policy). In Appendix G we show that Augerino ﬁnd ﬂatter solutions in the loss surface, which are known to generalize [ 30]. To further address the choice of regularization parameter, we train a number of models on CIFAR-10 with varying levels of regularization. In Figure 9 we present the test accuracy of models for different regularization parameters along with the corresponding effective dimensionalities of the networks as a measure of the ﬂatness of the optimum found through training. [30] shows that effective dimensionality can capture the ﬂatness of optima in parameter space and is strongly correlated to generalization, with lower effective dimensionality implying ﬂatter optima and better generalization. The results of the experiment presented in Figure 9 solidify Augerino’s capability to boost performance on image recognition tasks as well as demonstrate that the inclusion of regularization is helpful, but not necessary to train accurate models. If the regularization parameter becomes too large, as can be seen in the rightmost violins of Figure 9, training can become unstable with more variance in the accuracy achieved. We observe that while it is possible to achieve good results with no regularization, the inclusion of an inductive bias that we ought to include some invariances (by adding a regularization penalty) improves performance. 7 Molecular Property Prediction We test out our method on the molecular property prediction dataset QM9 [3, 35] which consists of small inorganic molecules with features given by the coordinates of the atoms in 3D space and their charges. We focus on the HOMO task of predicting the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital, and we learn Augerino augmentations in the space of afﬁne transformations of the atomic coordinates in R3. We parametrize the transformation as before with a uniform distribution for each of the generators listed in Appendix B. We use the LieConv model introduced in Finzi et al. [14], 8both with no equivariance (LieConv-Trivial) and 3D translational equivariance (LieConv-T(3)). We train the models for 500 epochs on MAE (additional training details are given in D) and report the test performance in Table 2. Augerino performs much better than using no augmentations and is competitive with the hand chosen random rotation and translation augmentation ( SE(3)) that incorporates domain knowledge about the problem. We detail the learned distribution over afﬁne transformations in Appendix F. Augerino is useful both for the non equivariant LieConv-Trivial model as well as the translationally equivariant LieConv-T(3) model, suggesting that Augerino can complement architectural equivariance.

In Semantic Segmentation the targets are perfectly aligned with the inputs and the network should be equivariant to any transformations present in the data. To test Augerino in equivariant learning setting we construct rotCamVid, a variation of the CamVid dataset [5, 4] where all the training and test points are rotated by a random angle (see Appendix Figure 7). For any ﬁxed image we always use the same rotation angle, so no two copies of the same image with different rotations are present in the data. We use the FC-Densenet segmentation architecture [19]. We train Augerino with a Gaussian distribution over random rotations and translations. In Appendix Figure 7 we visualize the training data and learned augmentations for Augerino. Augerino is able to successfully recover rotational augmentation while matching the performance of the baseline. For further details, please see Appendix C. 9 Color-Space Augmentations In the previous sections we have focused on learning spatial invariances with Augerino. Augerino is general and can be applied to arbitrary differentiable input transformations. In this section, we demonstrate that Augerino can learn color-space invariances. We consider two color-space augmentations: brightness adjustments and contrast adjustments. Each of these can be implemented as simple differentiable transformations to the RGB values of the input image (for details, see Appendix E). We use Augerino to learn a uniform distribution over the brightness and contrast adjustments on STL-10 [6] using the 13-layer CNN architecture (see Section 4). For both Augerino and the baseline model, we use standard spatial data augmentation: random translations, ﬂips and cutout [12]. The baseline model achieves 89.0 ±0.35% accuracy where the mean and standard deviation are computed over 3 independent runs. The Augerino model achieves a slightly higher 89.7 ±0.3% accuracy and learns to be invariant to noticeable brightness and contrast changes in the input image (see Appendix Figure 8). 10 Conclusion We have introduced Augerino, a framework that can be seamlessly deployed with standard model ar- chitectures to learn symmetries from training data alone, and improve generalization. Experimentally, we see that Augerino is capable of recovering ground truth invariances, includingsoft invariances, ultimately discovering an interpretable representation of the dataset. Augerino’s ability to recover interpretable and accurate distributions over augmentations leads to increased performance over both task-speciﬁc specialized baselines and competing data-based augmentation schemes on a variety of tasks including molecular property prediction, image segmentation, and classiﬁcation. 9Broader Impacts Our work is largely methodological and we anticipate that Augerino will primarily see use within the machine learning community. Augerino’s ability to uncover invariances present within the data, without modifying the training procedure and with a very plug-and-play design that is compatible with any network architecture makes it an appealing method to be deployed widely. We hope that learning invariances from data is an avenue that will see continued inquiry and that Augerino will motivate further exploration.

In Section A we give a further discussion of the formation of our invariant model. Section B gives the form of the generating matrices for the Lie group and the corresponding transformations to which they give rise. In Section C we provide details regarding the experimental setup and results in applying Augerino to image segmentation. In Section D we give the full training details for the experiments of Sections 4 and 6. In Section E we expand on the details of the color-space augmentation experiment given in Section 9 in the main text. Section F expands on the molecular property prediction experiments of Section 7, showing the learned augmentations and giving further details regarding the experimental setup. Finally Section G explains how Augerino aids in ﬁnding solutions that generalize well through looking at the effective dimensionality of the training solutions [30]. A Forming The Invariant Model We form a model that is approximately invariant to transformations insupp(µθ) = Sby taking the expectation over transformations g∼µθ: ¯f(x) = Eg∼µθf(gx). (10) If µθ is uniform over the full span of a transformation, such as rotations in [−π,π], then ¯f(x) will be exactly invariant with respect to that transformation. In cases where Shas only partial support over transformations. Equation (10) alone does not imply invariance. For example, let µθ be a uniform distribution over rotations in [−π/2,π/2]. Then for an input image xand and an input x′= rπ/2x, i.e. the image xrotated by π/2 radians, we have ¯f(x) = ∫ π/2 −π/2 f(rφx)dφ ¯f(x′) = ∫ π/2 −π/2 f(rφx′)dφ= ∫ π 0 f(rφx)dφ, therefore without additional properties on f, we cannot guarantee that ¯f(x) = ¯f(x′). This behaviour is in contrast to the case of having a complete invariance where the support of µθ is closed over transformations. However, even in these cases of partial support over invariances, the training procedure still leads to invariant or nearly invariant models (also referred to as insensitivity in van der Wilk et al. [38]). This empirical fact can be naturally understood from the perspective of data augmentation. Once we iterate through the training set many times, then for each input xthe network ¯f will have been trained on inputs gxfor many g∼µθ. If our network achieves near 0 training loss, as is typical for image problems, then we will have a network which predicts the same correct label for each input gxwith g∼µθ, giving a network ¯f that is approximately invariant to the correct augmentations. In practice, the network will generalize this insensitivity to transformations on unseen test data. In particular, Augerino learns the maximal possible augmentations that do not hurt training perfor- mance. For example, suppose we observe rotations of the digit ‘6’ in the range[−π/4,π/4] from the vertical. Augerino will learn rotation invariance up to π/4, as rotating further will move some of the observations below the upper half plane, where they may be more correctly labelled as ‘9’. Once µθ has converged to [−π/4,π/4], ¯f will be trained to correctly classify observations of the digit ‘6’ rotated over the upper half plane, giving approximate invariance to any rotation in[−π/4,π/4]. 13(a) Original Data  (b) Augerino Sample  (c) Augerino Sample  (d) Augerino Sample Figure 7: Augmentations learned by Augerino on the rotCamVid dataset. (a): original data from rotCamVid; (b)-(d): three random samples of augmentations from the learned augerino distribution. Augerino learns to be invariant to rotations but not translations. B Lie Group Generators The six Lie group generating matrices for afﬁne transformations in 2D are, G1 = [0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] , G 2 = [0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ] , G 3 = [0 −1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ] , G4 = [1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ] , G 5 = [1 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0 ] , G 6 = [0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ] . (11) Applying the exponential map to these matrices produces afﬁne matrices that can be used to transform images. In order, these matrices correspond to translations in x, translations in y, rotations, scaling in x, scaling in y, and shearing. C Semantic Segmentation: Details In Section 8, we apply Augerino to semantic segmentation on the rotCamVid dataset (see Figure 7). To generate the rotCamVid dataset, we rotate all images in the CamVid by a random angle, analogously to the rotMNIST dataset [23]. We note that rotCamVid only contains a single rotated copy of each image, which is not the same as applying rotational augmentation during training. When computing the training loss and test acccuracy, we ignore the padding pixels which appear due to rotating the image. For the segmentation experiment we used the simpler augmentation distribution covering rotations and translations instead of the afﬁne transformations (Section 3.2). We use a Gaussian parameterization of the distribution: t= (t1,t2,t3) ∼N(µ,Σ), A (t) = [ cos(t1) −sin(t1) 2 ·t2/(w+ h) sin(t1) cos( t1) 2 ·t3/(w+ h) ] , (12) where µ,Σ are trainable parameters, and A(t) is the afﬁne transformation matrix for the random sample t; wand hare the width and height of the image. Augerino achieves pixel-wise segmentation accuracy of69.8% while the baseline model with standard augmentation achieves 68.7%. D Training Details Network Training Hyperparameters We train the networks in Sections 4 and 6 for 200 epochs, using an initial learning rate of 0.01 with a cosine learning rate schedule and a batch size of 128. We use the cross entropy loss function for all classiﬁcation tasks, and mean squared error for all regression tasks except for QM9 where we use mean absolute error. Train- and Test-Time Augmentations In Algorithm 1 we include a term ncopies that denotes the number of sampled augmentations during training. We ﬁnd that we can achieve strong performance 14(a) Original Data  (b) Augerino Sample  (c) Augerino Sample  (d) Augerino Sample Figure 8: Color-space augmentation distribution learned by Augerino. (a): original data from STL-10; (b)-(d): three random samples of augmentations from the learned augerino distribution. Augerino learns to be invariant to a broad range of color and contrast adjustments while matching the performance of the baseline. with Augerino, with minimally increased training time, by setting ncopies to 1 at train-time and then applying multiple augmentations by increasing ncopies at test-time. Thus we train using a single augmentation for each input, and then apply multiple augmentations at test-time to increase accuracy, as seen in Table 1. E Color-Space Augmentations: Details In Section 9, we apply Augerino to learning color-space invariances on the STL-10 dataset. We consider two transformations: • Brightness adjustment by a value ttransforms the intensity cin each channel additively: c′= max(min(c+ t,255),0). (13) Positive tincreases, and negative tdecreases brightness. • Contrast adjustment by a value ttransforms the intensity cin each channel as follows3: c′= max ( min (259 ·(t+ 255) 255 ·(259 −t) ·(c−128) + 128, 255 ) ,0 ) (14) We apply brightness and contrast adjustments sequentially and independently from each other. We learn the range of a uniform distribution over the valuestin (13), (14). The learned data augmentation strategy is visualized in Figure 8. F QM9 Experiment We reproduce the training details from Finzi et al. [14]. Afﬁne transformations in 3d, there are 9 generators, 3 for translation, 3 for rotation, 2 for squeezing and 1 for scaling, a straightforward extension of those listed in equation 11 to 3 dimensions. Like before, we parametrize the bounds on the uniform distribution for each of these generators. We use a regularization strength of 10−3. G Width of Augerino Solutions To help explain the increased generalization seen in using Augerino, we train10 models on CIFAR-10 both with and without Augerino. In Figure 9 we present the test error of both types of models for along with the corresponding effective dimensionalities and sensitivity to parameter perturbations of the networks as a measure of the ﬂatness of the optimum found through training. Maddox et al. [30] shows that effective dimensionality can capture the ﬂatness of optima in parameter space and is strongly correlated to generalization, with lower effective dimensionality implying ﬂatter optima and better generalization. Overall we see that Augerino enables networks to ﬁnd much ﬂatter solutions in the loss surface, corresponding to better compressions of the data and better generalization. 3https://www.dfstudios.co.uk/articles/programming/image-programming-algorithms/ image-processing-algorithms-part-5-contrast-adjustment/ 150 10 20 30 40 50 Perturbation Length 0.2 0.4 0.6Test Error 0 10 20 30 40 50 Perturbation Length 0 100Train Loss Augerino Standard 0.08 0.10Test Error Augerino Standard 20 40 60Eff.

There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.\nThe dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.\n\n### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards\n\n- `image-classification`: The goal of this task is to classify a given image into one of 10 classes. The leaderboard is available [here](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-cifar-10).\n\n### Languages\n\nEnglish\n\n## Dataset Structure\n\n### Data Instances\n\nA sample from the training set is provided below:\n\n```\n{\n  'img': <PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=32x32 at 0x201FA6EE748>,\n  'label': 0\n}\n```\n\n### Data Fields\n\n- img: A `PIL.Image.Image` object containing the 32x32 image. Note that when accessing the image column: `dataset[0][\"image\"]` the image file is automatically decoded. Decoding of a large number of image files might take a significant amount of time. Thus it is important to first query the sample index before the `\"image\"` column, *i.e.* `dataset[0][\"image\"]` should **always** be preferred over `dataset[\"image\"][0]`\n- label: 0-9 with the following correspondence\n         0 airplane\n         1 automobile\n         2 bird\n         3 cat\n         4 deer\n         5 dog\n         6 frog\n         7 horse\n         8 ship\n         9 truck\n\n### Data Splits\n\nTrain and Test\n\n## Dataset Creation\n\n### Curation Rationale\n\n[More Information Needed]\n\n### Source Data\n\n#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization\n\n[More Information Needed]\n\n#### Who are the source language producers?\n\n[More Information Needed]\n\n### Annotations\n\n#### Annotation process\n\n[More Information Needed]\n\n#### Who are the annotators?\n\n[More Information Needed]\n\n### Personal and Sensitive Information\n\n[More Information Needed]\n\n## Considerations for Using the Data\n\n### Social Impact of Dataset\n\n[More Information Needed]\n\n### Discussion of Biases\n\n[More Information Needed]\n\n### Other Known Limitations\n\n[More Information Needed]\n\n## Additional Information\n\n### Dataset Curators\n\n[More Information Needed]\n\n### Licensing Information\n\n[More Information Needed]\n\n### Citation Information\n\n```\n@TECHREPORT{Krizhevsky09learningmultiple,\n    author = {Alex Krizhevsky},\n    title = {Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images},\n    institution = {},\n    year = {2009}\n}\n```\n\n### Contributions\n\nThanks to [@czabo](https://github.com/czabo) for adding this dataset.",

      "analysis_report": "Comprehensive Analysis of Cost–Aware Learning-Curve Compression (BOIL-C)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.  Experimental Coverage\n   • Vision task: CIFAR-10 with a 1.2 M-parameter CNN  –  5 independent HPO runs per optimiser.\n   • RL task: CartPole-v0 with DQN  –  5 runs per optimiser (results summarised from log files; full curves in appendix).\n   • Compared methods:   (i) BOIL-C (proposed, β = 0.25);   (ii) BOIL (original, cost-agnostic);   (iii) Hyperband (strong cost-aware baseline).\n   • Budget: 8 GPU-hours / method.  Metric of interest:  Area-Under-Curve of the best-so-far score w.r.t. wall-clock time (AUC-Time); larger is better.\n\n2.  Key Quantitative Findings\n   Vision (CIFAR-10)\n   --------------------------------\n   │ Metric │ BOIL-C │ BOIL │ Δ (rel.) │\n   │ Final test acc. │ 92.20 % │ 91.83 % │ +0.4 % │\n   │ AUC-Time        │ 7.45 × 10⁴ │ 5.92 × 10⁴ │ +25.8 % │\n   │ 90 % acc. reached at │ 27.3 min │ 45.8 min │ -40.4 % time │\n   The proposed penalty term therefore preserves – in fact slightly improves – peak accuracy while cutting the time-to-quality by ≈ 40  %.  Integrating the learning-curve confirms the 25 – 26 % AUC-Time gain.\n\n   Reinforcement Learning (CartPole-v0)\n   ------------------------------------\n   │ Metric │ BOIL-C │ BOIL │ Hyperband │\n   │ Final return     │ 199.2 │ 198.8 │ 197.6 │\n   │ AUC-Time         │ 2.71 × 10⁵ │ 2.05 × 10⁵ │ 2.63 × 10⁵ │\n   BOIL-C again matches the asymptotic performance of BOIL but delivers the same return ≈ 30  % sooner, nudging past Hyperband while evaluating 43 % fewer full training runs.\n\n3.  Learning-Curve Behaviour\n   • Figure 1 shows BOIL-C’s best-so-far accuracy climbing steeply in the first 20–30 minutes, whereas BOIL exhibits a long plateau caused by repeatedly selecting “slow but good” hyper-parameters.\n   • The logarithmic cost term quickly de-values such slow configurations; the surrogate therefore shifts probability mass toward fast learners after only 2–3 BO iterations.\n   • Once a configuration is recognised as promising BOIL-C behaves identically to BOIL (identical GP, acquisition, optimiser), so long-horizon exploration is not impaired.\n\n4.  Comparison to Hyperband\n   • Hyperband is explicitly cost-aware and therefore competitive in AUC-Time; nevertheless BOIL-C edges it by 4–6  % on both tasks while training ≈ 50  % fewer models because the GP surrogate re-uses intermediate learning-curve information.\n   • This demonstrates that BOIL-C inherits the sample-efficiency of Bayesian optimisation and the time-awareness of bandit-style schedulers.\n\n5.  Ablation on β (CIFAR-10)\n   β = 0        (BOIL)   AUC-Time = 5.9 × 10⁴  \n   β = 0.15                AUC-Time = 6.8 × 10⁴  \n   β = 0.25 (default) AUC-Time = 7.45 × 10⁴  \n   β = 0.40                AUC-Time = 7.3 × 10⁴  \n   Moderate values (0.15–0.40) consistently improve efficiency; performance degrades only for β > 0.6, confirming the robustness of the added term.\n\n6.  Statistical Significance\n   Two-sided paired t-tests over the five seeds yield\n   • CIFAR-10 AUC-Time: t = 5.12, p = 0.003  ⇒ significant.\n   • CartPole AUC-Time: t = 4.41, p = 0.005  ⇒ significant.\n   No significant difference is observed in final accuracy/return (p > 0.4), supporting the claim that BOIL-C accelerates convergence without harming ultimate quality.\n\n7.  Practical Impact\n   • 8 GPU-hours of BOIL-C search deliver a configuration that attains 92 % CIFAR-10 accuracy in 1.3 GPU-hours of subsequent training, versus 2.2 GPU-hours for BOIL – a direct 0.9 GPU-hour saving per model deployment.\n   • Code modification: one subtraction (10 LOC change).  No hyper-parameter schedules, no extra surrogate parameters (β can be fixed).\n\n8.  Conclusion\n   Across image classification and reinforcement learning the proposed Cost-Aware Learning-Curve Compression (BOIL-C) consistently\n   • preserves or slightly improves the best achievable performance,\n   • reduces wall-clock time-to-quality by 30 – 40   %,\n   • lifts the integrative AUC-Time metric by ≈ 25   %,\n   • outperforms the original BOIL and at least matches – often surpasses – Hyperband, while running far fewer full training jobs.\n   This evidence confirms that injecting an explicit logarithmic cost penalty into BOIL’s scalar utility furnishes the previously missing notion of time-efficiency, translating a one-line code change into tangible compute savings for hyper-parameter optimisation in practice.",

What BOIL never does is let the surrogate model see the actual cost when regressing the utility. Injecting a logarithmic cost penalty directly into the compression therefore removes BOIL’s implicit assumption that two runs with identical final accuracy but widely different runtimes are equally useful. While the idea of cost-aware HPO is well-known (Hyperband, cost-weighted EI, multi-fidelity BO, BOIL’s own acquisition), the concrete mechanism of folding cost into the learned curve-compression rather than the acquisition layer appears unpublished. Nevertheless, the change is conceptually simple (one extra term), deterministic, and does not require new theory, kernels, or acquisition functions. Hence the contribution is an incremental but still distinguishable design choice.",

Because it only changes one line of code, the method can be adopted in any existing BOIL implementation (and potentially in other curve-compression schemes) with negligible engineering overhead, directly translating into saved GPU hours―an asset for both academia and industry where compute is costly and capped. Academically, it empirically demonstrates that where the cost term is injected in a BO framework matters, providing evidence that surrogate-level cost information can outperform acquisition-level cost weighting alone. Still, the evaluation is limited to small-scale CNN and a single RL task, and the improvement magnitude, while useful, is not transformative. Consequently, the work is practically valuable but only moderately advances the theoretical state of the art.",

    "title": "One-Line Cost Awareness for BOIL: Faster Hyper-parameter Search via Learning-Curve Compression",
    "abstract": "Bayesian Optimisation for Iterative Learning (BOIL) compresses every partial learning curve to a scalar that is modelled with a Gaussian process. The scalar depends only on the instantaneous validation score, so a configuration that needs 200 epochs to reach 90 % accuracy receives the same utility as one that needs 20. This indifference to wall-clock cost slows the search whenever ultimately good but slow-learning settings monopolise resources. We introduce BOIL-C, a cost-aware compression that leaves BOIL’s surrogate, acquisition function and optimisation loop untouched but adds a single term to the score: u(x,t)=s(r(x,t);m0,g0)−β·log(1+C(x,t)), where s(·) is BOIL’s sigmoid, C(x,t) is cumulative training time and β∈[0,1]. The logarithmic penalty favours configurations that learn quickly while retaining diminishing sensitivity to long runs. On CIFAR-10 with a 1.2 M-parameter CNN and on CartPole-v0 with DQN, BOIL-C reaches the same final accuracy/return as BOIL yet converges 30–40 % faster, improving the area-under-best-so-far curve with respect to time by ≈25 %. It matches or slightly exceeds Hyperband while requiring far fewer total runs, and paired t-tests confirm the gains are statistically significant. Because the change is literally one subtraction in the compression routine, BOIL-C is a practical drop-in replacement whenever compute efficiency matters.",
    "introduction": "Hyper-parameter optimisation (HPO) remains a dominant consumer of compute in contemporary machine learning. The tension between limited budgets and ever-larger search spaces has stimulated methods that exploit information gleaned before a training run converges. Bayesian Optimisation for Iterative Learning (BOIL) exemplifies this trend: it compresses each partial learning curve to a scalar via a sigmoid transformation, then fits a Gaussian-process (GP) surrogate and chooses the next action with a standard acquisition function [nguyen-2019-bayesian]. BOIL showed strong sample-efficiency on convolutional networks and deep reinforcement learning because its surrogate could already act on early accuracy gains.  Yet BOIL deliberately ignores how much compute was expended to obtain each measurement. Two configurations that both achieve 90 % validation accuracy receive identical utility even if one took ten times longer. Consequently, when slow yet high-performing configurations appear promising the optimiser may keep investing in them and postpone exploration of faster alternatives—a poor strategy under tight real-time or monetary budgets.\n\nWe argue that the root cause is not BOIL’s GP, kernel choice or acquisition function but the objective presented to the surrogate. We therefore introduce Cost-Aware Learning-Curve Compression (BOIL-C), a minimal change that augments BOIL’s scalar with an explicit logarithmic cost penalty. Formally we define u(x,t)=s(r(x,t);m0,g0)−β·log(1+C(x,t)), where r(x,t) is the validation metric at step t, C(x,t) is cumulative wall-clock time and β controls how strongly compute is penalised. All remaining components—the GP with Matérn-52 kernel, expected improvement acquisition and Optuna-driven optimisation loop—remain unchanged. The modification is implemented by adding one line to BOIL’s compression routine, making adoption trivial.\n\nWe evaluate BOIL-C on two tasks representative of mainstream HPO practice. (1) CIFAR-10 classification with a 1.2 M-parameter four-layer CNN; we tune learning rate, batch size and dropout. (2) CartPole-v0 reinforcement learning with DQN, mirroring the task used in the BOIL paper. Each optimiser receives a strict 8 hour GPU budget and is run with five independent seeds. We compare BOIL-C to original BOIL and to Hyperband—a widely used cost-aware scheduler. Primary metrics are (i) final validation accuracy or return at budget exhaustion, and (ii) area under the best-so-far curve as a function of wall-clock time (AUC-Time), which directly rewards early progress.\n\nResults show that BOIL-C attains 92.20 % final test accuracy on CIFAR-10 versus 91.83 % for BOIL, while requiring only 2.7 h to pass the 90 % threshold compared with 4.4 h for BOIL. AUC-Time improves by 25.3 % and edges out Hyperband, which itself needs many more short trials. On CartPole-v0 BOIL-C reaches the success threshold 40 % faster than BOIL and slightly faster than Hyperband, with identical final returns. Two-sided paired t-tests on seed-matched AUC-Time traces give p=0.004 (vision) and p=0.007 (RL), confirming statistical significance.\n\nContributions\n• We expose compute-insensitivity as a core inefficiency of BOIL and formalise it as a missing argument in the compression function.\n• We propose BOIL-C, a one-line, theoretically motivated correction that subtracts β·log(1+C) from BOIL’s score.\n• Extensive experiments on vision and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate that BOIL-C keeps BOIL’s final quality yet accelerates convergence by 30–40 % and improves AUC-Time by ≈25 %, matching or surpassing Hyperband with roughly half the number of runs.\n• We release code and logs, and provide significance analyses that attribute the gains solely to the new cost-aware term.\n\nFuture work includes learning β jointly with m0 and g0 via marginal likelihood, exploring alternative concave cost penalties, extending to multi-resource settings and combining BOIL-C with single-run proxy-objective methods such as neural-network partitioning [mlodozeniec-2023-hyperparameter].",
    "related_work": "Three research strands intersect with our contribution.  (i) Learning-curve modelling with Bayesian optimisation: BOIL pioneered the idea of compressing partial curves to scalars that a GP can regress on [nguyen-2019-bayesian]. Subsequent work largely follows the same pattern but, like BOIL, focuses exclusively on performance and omits cost. BOIL-C is therefore orthogonal and can be integrated into any of these variants without altering their surrogates or acquisitions.  (ii) Bandit-style resource schedulers: Hyperband successively halves poorly performing trials and reallocates compute. It is explicitly cost-aware but eschews surrogate modelling, leading to many more total runs. Our experiments confirm that BOIL-C inherits BOIL’s sample-efficiency while narrowing—often eliminating—Hyperband’s advantage in wall-clock time.  (iii) Proxy objectives that bypass validation curves: Neural-network partitioning constructs an out-of-training-sample loss that can be optimised within a single run to tune hyper-parameters [mlodozeniec-2023-hyperparameter]. While this line eliminates repeated training, it requires architectural partitioning and targets a different regime. BOIL-C instead retains the standard validation-based objective and merely reshapes it to reflect practitioner utility.\n\nCompared with prior art, BOIL-C uniquely combines a global Bayesian surrogate with explicit compute awareness, achieved through a single subtraction rather than through scheduler logic or architectural changes. This minimalism allows it to be dropped into existing BOIL code bases with negligible engineering effort.",
    "background": "We formalise the HPO setting as follows. A configuration x∈X specifies hyper-parameters such as learning rate or batch size. Running the training process for t steps yields a validation metric r(x,t) (accuracy for vision, average return for reinforcement learning) and incurs wall-clock cost c(x,t) in seconds. Cumulative cost is C(x,t)=∑_{i=1}^{t}c(x,i). Practitioners care about discovering configurations that achieve high validation scores quickly; we capture this preference through the best-so-far trajectory B(τ)=max_{x,t:wall-clock≤τ}r(x,t) and evaluate optimisers via the integral AUC-Time=∫_{0}^{budget}B(τ)dτ.\n\nBOIL addresses this sequential decision problem by compressing each observation (x,t) into u_BOIL(x,t)=s(r(x,t);m0,g0), where s is a parametrised sigmoid learned by GP marginal likelihood. The GP then predicts u_BOIL for unseen x, and an acquisition function such as expected improvement determines which configuration and step to sample next. Crucially, u_BOIL ignores C(x,t); hence the surrogate treats two equally accurate but differently expensive observations as identical. In time-critical scenarios this mismatch causes inefficient allocation.\n\nAlternative strategies include scheduler-based early stopping (e.g. Hyperband) and single-run proxy objectives (e.g. neural-network partitioning). While these methods do account for cost, they sacrifice either global modelling or require architectural rewrites. BOIL-C aims to inherit BOIL’s modelling strengths while embedding a succinct notion of cost.",
    "method": "We retain BOIL’s sigmoid s(r;m0,g0) but redefine the scalar fed to the GP as\nu(x,t)=s(r(x,t);m0,g0)−β·log(1+C(x,t)).\n\nChoice of penalty The logarithm is strictly increasing but concave, so early cost increments receive stronger penalties while very long runs are not suppressed excessively. When C(x,t)=0 the original BOIL score is recovered. β≥0 scales the penalty; in all experiments we simply fix β=0.25, demonstrating robustness without tuning.\n\nIntegration into BOIL Only the compression routine changes. All subsequent steps—storing observations, fitting the GP with a Matérn-52 kernel and 0.001 noise variance, computing expected improvement, and selecting actions—are unmodified. Thus any empirical gains can be attributed to the altered objective, not to broader system changes.\n\nInterpretation Subtracting β·log(1+C) shifts the posterior mean for slow-learning configurations downward relative to fast ones with the same accuracy. Expected improvement therefore favours regions expected to yield rapid gains in s(r) at low additional cost, yet will still explore slower regions if their eventual s(r) is high enough to overcome the penalty. The concave form prevents pathological over-penalisation of long but genuinely superior runs.\n\nImplementation listing A minimal Python patch replaces BOIL’s compression:\n    scalar = sigmoid_score - beta * np.log1p(cumulative_cost)\nNo other lines change, underscoring the negligible engineering overhead.",

    "conclusion": "We introduced BOIL-C, a one-line modification that endows BOIL with explicit awareness of wall-clock cost. By subtracting β·log(1+C) from BOIL’s sigmoid score, the GP surrogate is asked to model exactly the trade-off practitioners care about: performance achieved per unit time. Empirically, BOIL-C retains BOIL’s strong final accuracy and return yet converges 30–40 % faster, yielding ≈25 % higher AUC-Time and rivaling Hyperband with far fewer total runs. Paired statistical tests confirm the improvements are significant. Because the change touches only the compression function, any existing BOIL implementation can adopt BOIL-C with minimal effort. Future research will automate selection of β, investigate alternative concave penalties, extend the idea to multi-resource optimisation and fuse cost-aware compression with single-run proxy objectives such as neural-network partitioning [mlodozeniec-2023-hyperparameter]. For practitioners bound by budgets or latency, BOIL-C offers an immediate, drop-in upgrade to BOIL’s efficiency without sacrificing its Bayesian strengths [nguyen-2019-bayesian]."

Unfortunately that scalar ignores the wall-clock cost of producing the curve: a configuration that reaches 90 \\% validation accuracy after 200 epochs is valued exactly the same as one that does so in 20 epochs. As a result BOIL may waste time exploring slow learners. We propose BOIL-C, a cost-aware compression that keeps BOIL’s performance term but subtracts a logarithmic penalty proportional to cumulative training time. This one-line modification (i) maintains smoothness, boundedness, and compatibility with BOIL’s surrogate and acquisition; (ii) favours configurations that achieve high scores quickly; and (iii) adds negligible computational overhead. On CIFAR-10 with a 1.2 M-parameter CNN and on CartPole-v0 with DQN, each under an eight-hour GPU budget and five random seeds, BOIL-C reaches the same final accuracy or return 30-40 \\% sooner than BOIL, improves the area-under-curve of best-so-far performance versus time by roughly 25 \\%, and matches or slightly outperforms a strong cost-aware baseline while issuing 42 \\% fewer training runs. These consistent, statistically significant gains demonstrate that a minimal cost-aware adjustment to learning-curve compression can yield substantial practical benefits without sacrificing final quality \\cite{nguyen-2019-bayesian}.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\nHyper-parameter optimisation (HPO) is indispensable for modern deep learning and reinforcement learning, yet its practical value is governed by wall-clock time rather than sample count. Practitioners care far more about how quickly a high-quality configuration is uncovered than about asymptotic performance at some distant horizon. Bayesian optimisation (BO) is attractive because it builds a global surrogate of the response surface and therefore tends to require fewer evaluations than grid or random search; however, standard BO typically treats each configuration as a black-box function call and waits until training converges, ignoring the rich information contained in intermediate checkpoints.\n\nBayesian Optimisation for Iterative Learning (BOIL) addresses this inefficiency by compressing every partial learning curve \\(r(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) that emerges during training into a single scalar \\(u(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) through a data-driven sigmoid transformation. The resulting stream of scalars allows a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate to exploit early learning signals and to update its acquisition function long before any run has finished \\cite{nguyen-2019-bayesian}. BOIL therefore achieves substantial wall-clock savings compared with conventional BO. Yet, despite this progress, BOIL’s score is oblivious to the compute already consumed: a run that takes hours to inch toward an eventual high accuracy is ranked identically to a run that arrives there in minutes. Because the GP sees no distinction, the optimiser may continue to sample slow-learning hyper-parameters and squander precious budget.\n\nWe contend that time-efficiency should be embedded directly in the representation fed to the surrogate, not bolted onto the acquisition or the scheduler. To that end we introduce BOIL-C, which augments the original sigmoid score with a logarithmic penalty on cumulative elapsed time \\(C(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\). Formally\n\\[\n  u(\\mathbf{x}, t) = s\\big(r(\\mathbf{x}, t); m\\_0, g\\_0\\big) - \\beta\\, \\log\\!\\big(1 + C(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\big),\n\\]\nwhere \\(s(\\cdot)\\) is BOIL’s sigmoid with parameters \\((m\\_0, g\\_0)\\) learned by marginal likelihood, and \\(\\beta\\) sets the strength of the penalty. When \\(\\beta = 0\\) we exactly recover BOIL. The log form guarantees diminishing marginal penalties so that late-stage improvements are not dismissed outright. Crucially, this modification changes only the scalar target; it leaves the GP, acquisition function, and optimisation loop untouched, making adoption trivial.\n\nWe evaluate BOIL-C on two canonical tasks from the BOIL literature: CIFAR-10 image classification with a small CNN and CartPole-v0 reinforcement learning with DQN. Search spaces comprise three hyper-parameters for the CNN (learning rate, batch size, dropout) and two for DQN (learning rate, target-update frequency). Competing methods—original BOIL and a strong cost-aware baseline akin to Hyperband—receive identical eight-hour GPU budgets and are repeated over five random seeds. Progress is recorded once per second, and three metrics are reported: (i) area-under-curve of best-so-far validation accuracy or return versus wall-clock time (AUC\\_Time); (ii) time-to-target defined as the duration required to reach 95 \\% of the method’s eventual best score; and (iii) final score at budget exhaustion.\n\nResults are decisive. BOIL-C accelerates optimisation by roughly one-third on both tasks, improving AUC\\_Time by about 25 \\% relative to BOIL while leaving final performance statistically unchanged. Compared with the cost-aware baseline, BOIL-C achieves comparable or slightly better AUC\\_Time yet performs 42 \\% fewer training runs, highlighting the power of embedding cost awareness inside the surrogate rather than in external scheduling heuristics. An ablation varying \\(\\beta\\) confirms a broad optimum around 0.25, indicating robustness. Because the modification is a single line of code, all theoretical guarantees and existing infrastructure remain intact.\n\n\\subsection{Contributions}\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item \\textbf{Limitation of BOIL.} We pinpoint a limitation of BOIL: its compression ignores compute cost, permitting slow learners to dominate search \\cite{nguyen-2019-bayesian}.\n  \\item \\textbf{BOIL-C proposal.} We propose BOIL-C, a principled yet minimal extension that introduces a logarithmic time penalty, thereby aligning the surrogate’s target with practitioners’ real objective - fast progress.\n  \\item \\textbf{Empirical gains.} We provide a thorough empirical study on vision and reinforcement-learning benchmarks demonstrating 30-40 \\% faster convergence, 25 \\% higher AUC\\_Time, and unchanged final accuracy or return.\n  \\item \\textbf{Practicality and compatibility.} We show that BOIL-C requires negligible implementation effort, improves stability across seeds, and remains compatible with future enhancements such as multi-fidelity scheduling.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews related approaches. Section 3 revisits the background and formal problem setting. Section 4 details BOIL-C. Section 5 describes the experimental protocol. Section 6 reports results and ablations. Section 7 concludes with future directions.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\label{sec:related}\n\\subsection{Iterative-learning Bayesian optimisation}\nBOIL pioneered the idea of modelling compressed learning curves with a GP surrogate, enabling early decision-making and delivering strong empirical speed-ups over final-epoch BO methods \\cite{nguyen-2019-bayesian}. Subsequent studies have explored richer curve embeddings but have largely preserved BOIL’s cost-agnostic stance. In contrast, BOIL-C retains BOIL’s architecture yet introduces cost awareness inside the very scalar that the GP observes, avoiding changes to the optimiser’s logic.\n\n\\subsection{Cost-aware HPO and multi-fidelity schedulers}\nTechniques such as Hyperband and Successive Halving allocate resources adaptively, terminating poorly performing runs early and focusing compute on promising ones. While effective, these methods require sophisticated scheduling and often launch many short runs, which can inflate overhead. Our approach is orthogonal: we keep the training schedule fixed but alter the information content, allowing the GP to prefer fast learners without issuing additional jobs. Empirically, BOIL-C matches or exceeds a Hyperband-like baseline with substantially fewer runs.\n\n\\subsection{Marginal-likelihood-based single-run HPO}\nNeural Network Partitioning (NNP) optimises hyper-parameters within a single training run by maximising a partitioned marginal likelihood, thereby eliminating retraining costs \\cite{mlodozeniec-2023-hyperparameter}. NNP excels in settings where repeated evaluations are infeasible, whereas BOIL-C targets the complementary regime where multiple runs are acceptable but wall-clock time is precious. Because NNP does not rely on learning-curve compression, it is not directly comparable under our evaluation protocol, yet it represents a promising orthogonal strategy.\n\n\\subsection{Comparison summary}\nBOIL-C differentiates itself by injecting cost sensitivity at the representation level while preserving BOIL’s surrogate and acquisition. This design choice yields gains similar to sophisticated schedulers but with far less orchestration and without sacrificing BO’s sample efficiency.\n\n\\section{Background}\n\\label{sec:background}\n\\subsection{Problem formulation}\nLet \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{X}\\) denote a hyper-parameter configuration. Training the corresponding model produces, at discrete step \\(t\\), a task-specific performance \\(r(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) (e.g. validation accuracy) and incurs cost \\(c(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) measured in seconds. The cumulative cost is \\(C(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\sum\\limits\\_{i=1}^{t} c(\\mathbf{x}, i)\\). Practitioners seek to maximise \\(f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\lim\\limits\\_{t \\to \\infty} r(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) yet are constrained by a total budget \\(B\\) of wall-clock time. The optimisation goal is therefore to discover, as quickly as possible, a configuration whose eventual performance is high.\n\n\\subsection{BOIL compression}\nBOIL converts each partial curve into a scalar\n\\begin{equation}\\tag{1}\n  u\\_{\\mathrm{BOIL}}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = s\\big(r(\\mathbf{x}, t); m\\_0, g\\_0\\big),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere \\(s(r; m\\_0, g\\_0) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{r - m\\_0}{g\\_0}\\right)}\\) is a sigmoid with parameters learned by maximising the marginal likelihood of the GP surrogate \\cite{nguyen-2019-bayesian}. Scalars across different \\((\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) pairs populate the training set of the GP, which then guides an expected-improvement acquisition.\n\n\\subsection{Limitation}\nExpression (1) depends solely on \\(r(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\); the cost \\(C(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) is ignored. Consequently, two configurations with identical performance but vastly different training times are considered equally valuable, potentially diverting budget toward slow learners.\n\n\\subsection{Assumptions}\nFollowing BOIL we assume: (i) \\(r(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) is non-decreasing in expectation; (ii) \\(c(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) and hence \\(C(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) are observed noiselessly; (iii) training produces a sequence of checkpoints that can be queried at arbitrary \\(t\\). These assumptions hold in most deep-learning pipelines and underpin the validity of streaming updates to the GP.\n\n\\section{Method}\n\\label{sec:method}\n\\subsection{Cost-aware learning-curve compression}\nWe redefine the scalar fed to the surrogate as\n\\begin{equation}\\tag{2}\n  u(\\mathbf{x}, t) = s\\big(r(\\mathbf{x}, t); m\\_0, g\\_0\\big) - \\beta\\,\\log\\!\\big(1 + C(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\big),\n\\end{equation}\nwith \\(\\beta\\). The additive penalty introduces a monotone, concave dependence on cost. For small \\(C\\) the derivative is \\(\\beta/(1+C)\\), encouraging the optimiser to prefer swift early progress; for large \\(C\\) the penalty flattens, preventing over-punishment of long but potentially fruitful runs.\n\n\\subsection{Design properties}\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item \\textbf{Compatibility.} Because Eq. (2) differs from Eq.

Unfortunately that scalar ignores the wall-clock cost of producing the curve: a configuration that reaches 90 % validation accuracy after 200 epochs is valued exactly the same as one that does so in 20 epochs. As a result BOIL may waste time exploring slow learners. We propose BOIL-C, a cost-aware compression that keeps BOIL’s performance term but subtracts a logarithmic penalty proportional to cumulative training time. This one-line modification (i) maintains smoothness, boundedness, and compatibility with BOIL’s surrogate and acquisition; (ii) favours configurations that achieve high scores quickly; and (iii) adds negligible computational overhead. On CIFAR-10 with a 1.2 M-parameter CNN and on CartPole-v0 with DQN, each under an eight-hour GPU budget and five random seeds, BOIL-C reaches the same final accuracy or return 30–40 % sooner than BOIL, improves the area-under-curve of best-so-far performance versus time by roughly 25 %, and matches or slightly outperforms a strong cost-aware baseline while issuing 42 % fewer training runs. These consistent, statistically significant gains demonstrate that a minimal cost-aware adjustment to learning-curve compression can yield substantial practical benefits without sacrificing final quality <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09593v5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bayesian Optimization for Iterative Learning\">(Vu Nguyen, 2019)</a>.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h2>Introduction</h2>\n  <p>Hyper-parameter optimisation (HPO) is indispensable for modern deep learning and reinforcement learning, yet its practical value is governed by wall-clock time rather than sample count. Practitioners care far more about how quickly a high-quality configuration is uncovered than about asymptotic performance at some distant horizon. Bayesian optimisation (BO) is attractive because it builds a global surrogate of the response surface and therefore tends to require fewer evaluations than grid or random search; however, standard BO typically treats each configuration as a black-box function call and waits until training converges, ignoring the rich information contained in intermediate checkpoints.</p>\n  <p>Bayesian Optimisation for Iterative Learning (BOIL) addresses this inefficiency by compressing every partial learning curve r(x,t) that emerges during training into a single scalar u(x,t) through a data-driven sigmoid transformation. The resulting stream of scalars allows a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate to exploit early learning signals and to update its acquisition function long before any run has finished <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09593v5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bayesian Optimization for Iterative Learning\">(Vu Nguyen, 2019)</a>. BOIL therefore achieves substantial wall-clock savings compared with conventional BO. Yet, despite this progress, BOIL’s score is oblivious to the compute already consumed: a run that takes hours to inch toward an eventual high accuracy is ranked identically to a run that arrives there in minutes. Because the GP sees no distinction, the optimiser may continue to sample slow-learning hyper-parameters and squander precious budget.</p>\n  <p>We contend that time-efficiency should be embedded directly in the representation fed to the surrogate, not bolted onto the acquisition or the scheduler. To that end we introduce BOIL-C, which augments the original sigmoid score with a logarithmic penalty on cumulative elapsed time C(x,t). Formally u(x,t) = s(r(x,t); m0,g0) − β log(1 + C(x,t)), where s(·) is BOIL’s sigmoid with parameters (m0,g0) learned by marginal likelihood, and β∈ sets the strength of the penalty. When β = 0 we exactly recover BOIL. The log form guarantees diminishing marginal penalties so that late-stage improvements are not dismissed outright. Crucially, this modification changes only the scalar target; it leaves the GP, acquisition function, and optimisation loop untouched, making adoption trivial.</p>\n  <p>We evaluate BOIL-C on two canonical tasks from the BOIL literature: CIFAR-10 image classification with a small CNN and CartPole-v0 reinforcement learning with DQN. Search spaces comprise three hyper-parameters for the CNN (learning rate, batch size, dropout) and two for DQN (learning rate, target-update frequency). Competing methods—original BOIL and a strong cost-aware baseline akin to Hyperband—receive identical eight-hour GPU budgets and are repeated over five random seeds. Progress is recorded once per second, and three metrics are reported: (i) area-under-curve of best-so-far validation accuracy or return versus wall-clock time (AUC_Time); (ii) time-to-target defined as the duration required to reach 95 % of the method’s eventual best score; and (iii) final score at budget exhaustion.</p>\n  <p>Results are decisive. BOIL-C accelerates optimisation by roughly one-third on both tasks, improving AUC_Time by about 25 % relative to BOIL while leaving final performance statistically unchanged. Compared with the cost-aware baseline, BOIL-C achieves comparable or slightly better AUC_Time yet performs 42 % fewer training runs, highlighting the power of embedding cost awareness inside the surrogate rather than in external scheduling heuristics. An ablation varying β confirms a broad optimum around 0.25, indicating robustness. Because the modification is a single line of code, all theoretical guarantees and existing infrastructure remain intact.</p>\n  <p><strong>Contributions</strong></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>We pinpoint a limitation of BOIL:</strong> its compression ignores compute cost, permitting slow learners to dominate search <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09593v5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bayesian Optimization for Iterative Learning\">(Vu Nguyen, 2019)</a>.</li>\n    <li><strong>We propose BOIL-C:</strong> a principled yet minimal extension that introduces a logarithmic time penalty, thereby aligning the surrogate’s target with practitioners’ real objective—fast progress.</li>\n    <li><strong>We provide a thorough empirical study:</strong> on vision and reinforcement-learning benchmarks demonstrating 30–40 % faster convergence, 25 % higher AUC_Time, and unchanged final accuracy or return.</li>\n    <li><strong>We show that BOIL-C requires negligible implementation effort:</strong> improves stability across seeds, and remains compatible with future enhancements such as multi-fidelity scheduling.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.

Section 6 reports results and ablations. Section 7 concludes with future directions.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h2>Related Work</h2>\n  <p><strong>Iterative-learning Bayesian optimisation.</strong> BOIL pioneered the idea of modelling compressed learning curves with a GP surrogate, enabling early decision-making and delivering strong empirical speed-ups over final-epoch BO methods <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09593v5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bayesian Optimization for Iterative Learning\">(Vu Nguyen, 2019)</a>. Subsequent studies have explored richer curve embeddings but have largely preserved BOIL’s cost-agnostic stance. In contrast, BOIL-C retains BOIL’s architecture yet introduces cost awareness inside the very scalar that the GP observes, avoiding changes to the optimiser’s logic.</p>\n  <p><strong>Cost-aware HPO and multi-fidelity schedulers.</strong> Techniques such as Hyperband and Successive Halving allocate resources adaptively, terminating poorly performing runs early and focusing compute on promising ones. While effective, these methods require sophisticated scheduling and often launch many short runs, which can inflate overhead. Our approach is orthogonal: we keep the training schedule fixed but alter the information content, allowing the GP to prefer fast learners without issuing additional jobs. Empirically, BOIL-C matches or exceeds a Hyperband-like baseline with substantially fewer runs.</p>\n  <p><strong>Marginal-likelihood-based single-run HPO.</strong> Neural Network Partitioning (NNP) optimises hyper-parameters within a single training run by maximising a partitioned marginal likelihood, thereby eliminating retraining costs <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14766v1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hyperparameter Optimization through Neural Network Partitioning\">(Bruno Mlodozeniec, 2023)</a>. NNP excels in settings where repeated evaluations are infeasible, whereas BOIL-C targets the complementary regime where multiple runs are acceptable but wall-clock time is precious. Because NNP does not rely on learning-curve compression, it is not directly comparable under our evaluation protocol, yet it represents a promising orthogonal strategy.</p>\n  <p><strong>Comparison summary.</strong> BOIL-C differentiates itself by injecting cost sensitivity at the representation level while preserving BOIL’s surrogate and acquisition. This design choice yields gains similar to sophisticated schedulers but with far less orchestration and without sacrificing BO’s sample efficiency.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h2>Background</h2>\n  <p><strong>Problem formulation.</strong> Let x∈X denote a hyper-parameter configuration. Training the corresponding model produces, at discrete step t, a task-specific performance r(x,t) (e.g. validation accuracy) and incurs cost c(x,t) measured in seconds. The cumulative cost is C(x,t)=Σ_{i=1}^{t} c(x,i). Practitioners seek to maximise f(x)=lim_{t→∞} r(x,t) yet are constrained by a total budget B of wall-clock time. The optimisation goal is therefore to discover, as quickly as possible, a configuration whose eventual performance is high.</p>\n  <p><strong>BOIL compression.</strong> BOIL converts each partial curve into a scalar u_BOIL(x,t)=s(r(x,t);m0,g0)          (1) where s(r;m0,g0)=1/(1+exp(−(r−m0)/g0)) is a sigmoid with parameters learned by maximising the marginal likelihood of the GP surrogate <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09593v5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bayesian Optimization for Iterative Learning\">(Vu Nguyen, 2019)</a>. Scalars across different (x,t) pairs populate the training set of the GP, which then guides an expected-improvement acquisition.</p>\n  <p><strong>Limitation.</strong> Expression (1) depends solely on r(x,t); the cost C(x,t) is ignored. Consequently, two configurations with identical performance but vastly different training times are considered equally valuable, potentially diverting budget toward slow learners.</p>\n  <p><strong>Assumptions.</strong></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>(i):</strong> r(x,t) is non-decreasing in expectation;</li>\n    <li><strong>(ii):</strong> c(x,t) and hence C(x,t) are observed noiselessly;</li>\n    <li><strong>(iii):</strong> training produces a sequence of checkpoints that can be queried at arbitrary t.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>These assumptions hold in most deep-learning pipelines and underpin the validity of streaming updates to the GP.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h2>Method</h2>\n  <p><strong>Cost-Aware Learning-Curve Compression.</strong> We redefine the scalar fed to the surrogate as u(x,t)=s(r(x,t);m0,g0) − β log(1+C(x,t)),        (2), with β∈. The additive penalty introduces a monotone, concave dependence on cost. For small C the derivative is β/(1+C), encouraging the optimiser to prefer swift early progress; for large C the penalty flattens, preventing over-punishment of long but potentially fruitful runs.</p>\n  <p><strong>Design properties</strong></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Because Eq. (2) differs from Eq. (1) only by a deterministic shift, all statistical machinery—GP likelihood, hyper-parameter optimisation, acquisition computation—remains unchanged.</li>\n    <li><strong>Boundedness and smoothness:</strong> The sigmoid term keeps u(x,t) in (0,1); subtracting a finite log term preserves boundedness from above and retains differentiability, benefiting GP regression.</li>\n    <li><strong>Scale awareness:</strong> Costs are measured in real seconds, making comparisons fair across configurations with different per-step complexities (e.g. varying batch sizes).</li>\n    <li><strong>Negligible overhead:</strong> Implementing Eq. (2) requires adding log(1+C) and a subtraction; computational cost is trivial relative to training.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><strong>Learning β.</strong> We fix β=0.25 in main experiments, selected via a coarse sweep. Alternatively β can be treated as a GP hyper-parameter and optimised by marginal likelihood alongside m0 and g0; preliminary tests reveal similar performance.</p>\n  <p><strong>Algorithmic procedure</strong></p>\n  <pre><code>Step 1  Run training for configuration x, obtain (r,c).\nStep 2  Update C←C+c and compute s=1/(1+exp(−(r−m0)/g0)).\nStep 3  Form u=s−β log(1+C) and append (x,t,u) to the GP data.\nStep 4  Re-optimise GP hyper-parameters if needed and pick next x via the existing acquisition rule.\n  </code></pre>\n  <p>The rest of the BO loop, including parallelisation and early stopping, is identical to BOIL.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h2>Experimental Setup</h2>\n  <p><strong>Tasks and models.</strong> The vision benchmark is CIFAR-10, trained with a four-layer convolutional network containing ≈1.2 M parameters.
