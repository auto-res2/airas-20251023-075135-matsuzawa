# Research Topic
Improving the efficiency of hyperparameter optimization

# New Method
{
    "Open Problems": "BOIL transforms every partial learning curve into a single scalar via a fixed-shape sigmoid. The score is independent of how much compute was spent to obtain the curve: a run that reaches 90% accuracy after 200 epochs receives the same utility as one that reaches 90% in 20 epochs. Consequently BOIL may keep sampling hyper-parameters that learn slowly but ultimately perform well, wasting wall-clock time.",
    "Methods": "Cost–Aware Learning-Curve Compression (BOIL-C).\nModification (one line change in the compression routine):\n    u(x,t) = s( r(x,t); m0,g0 )  –  β · log( 1 + C(x,t) )\nwhere\n• s(·) is BOIL’s original sigmoid compression,  \n• C(x,t)=∑_{i=1}^{t} c(x,i) is the cumulative observed training cost (in seconds),\n• β∈[0,1] is a small constant or learned alongside m0,g0 by marginal-likelihood maximisation.\n\nInterpretation: we keep BOIL’s performance-based score but subtract a logarithmic penalty that grows with consumed compute, favouring hyper-params that reach good scores quickly.  Only the single scalar fed to the GP changes; the surrogate, acquisition function and optimisation loop are untouched.",
    "Experimental Setup": "Datasets: CIFAR-10 image classification with a small CNN; CartPole-v0 reinforcement learning with DQN (same as BOIL).\nHyper-parameters to tune: learning-rate, batch-size, and dropout for CNN; lr and target-update for DQN.\nMethods compared:\n1) BOIL (original)\n2) BOIL-C (ours, β=0.25)\n3) Hyperband (strong cost-aware baseline)\nBudget: 8 GPU hours per method, 5 independent seeds.\nMetric: best validation accuracy (CNN) / average return (RL) reached versus wall-clock time.  Report area-under-curve (AUC) of best-so-far metric w.r.t. time.",
    "Experimental Code": "# --- key modification only ----------------------------------------------------\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# inside BOIL class, replace original compression -----------------------------\n\ndef compress_curve(sigmoid_score, cumulative_cost, beta=0.25):\n    \"\"\"Return cost-aware scalar for GP.  Inputs are scalars.\"\"\"\n    return sigmoid_score - beta * np.log1p(cumulative_cost)\n\n# example usage ---------------------------------------------------------------\n# r_t: current accuracy at epoch t, m0,g0 learned as in BOIL\nsigmoid_score = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-(r_t - m0)/g0))\nscalar_for_gp = compress_curve(sigmoid_score, cumulative_cost)\n# everything else in BOIL (GP update, acquisition, etc.) stays unchanged.",
    "Expected Result": "Across both tasks BOIL-C achieves the same final accuracy/return as BOIL but reaches it 30-40% faster in wall-clock time.  The AUC-time metric improves by ≈25% over BOIL and is on par or slightly better than Hyperband, while requiring far fewer total runs.",
    "Expected Conclusion": "Penalising training cost directly in the learning-curve compression gives BOIL the missing notion of time-efficiency with just one extra term.  The change is trivial to implement (one extra subtraction) yet shifts the search toward hyper-parameters that learn quickly, saving compute without sacrificing quality.  This demonstrates how a minimal, well-motivated modification can translate into meaningful practical gains for hyper-parameter optimisation."

    "Title": "Bayesian Optimization for Iterative Learning",
    "Main Contributions": "The paper introduces Bayesian Optimization for Iterative Learning (BOIL), an approach for efficient hyperparameter tuning of deep (reinforcement) learning systems. It addresses the high computational cost and iterative nature of training by: 1) proposing an algorithm to optimize the entire learning curve (instead of just final performance) through training curve compression into a single numeric score representing both training success and stability, 2) learning this compression function from data, and 3) employing a data augmentation technique that leverages intermediate training information to increase sample-efficiency and selectively include scores from different training steps while managing computational cost and avoiding Gaussian Process (GP) covariance conditioning issues. The method is demonstrated to outperform baselines in identifying optimal hyperparameters in minimal wall-clock time for DRL agents and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).",
    "Methodology": "The BOIL framework models the cost-sensitive black-box objective function f(x,t) (hyperparameter x and iterations t) as a Gaussian Process (GP) with a product kernel combining similarities over parameter and iteration space. Training time cost c(x,t) is approximated by a linear regressor. It uses a modified Expected Improvement acquisition function that balances high function value, high uncertainty, and low cost. A key component is training curve compression, where the entire learning curve r(·|x,t) is transformed into a single numeric utility score using a Sigmoid function l(·|m0,g0), whose parameters m0 and g0 are learned by maximizing the GP's log marginal likelihood. To improve sample-efficiency and prevent GP covariance matrix ill-conditioning, a data augmentation technique is used to selectively sample a subset of points from the observed learning curve, focusing on areas of high GP predictive uncertainty, rather than including the full curve.",
    "Experimental Setup": "Experiments were conducted on a NVIDIA 1080 GTX GPU using tensorflow-gpu, with results averaged over 20 independent runs with different random seeds. For Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), hyperparameters were tuned for a Dueling DQN agent on the CartPole-v0 environment and Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) agents on InvertedPendulum-v2 and Reacher-v2, leveraging OpenAI Gym and Mujoco. For Deep Learning (DL), hyperparameters were tuned for a Convolutional Neural Network on the SVHN and CIFAR10 datasets. The BOIL model used square-exponential kernels for its Gaussian Process, with kernel parameters and Logistic function parameters (m0, g0) learned by maximizing marginal likelihood. A maximum of 15 augmented points were used, with a condition number threshold of 20 for the natural log of the GP covariance matrix. Baselines included Hyperband and Continuous Multi-Task/Fidelity Bayesian Optimization (CM-T/F-BO), along with ablation studies comparing to vanilla Bayesian Optimization (BO) and BO with only Logistic curve compression (BO-L).",
    "Limitations": "The paper notes that the cost function c(x,t) is approximated by a linear regressor, suggesting that a more complex parametric model or a second Gaussian Process might be more appropriate if the cost has a more intricate dependency on hyperparameters and iterations. While the proposed data augmentation method addresses the ill-conditioning issues of the GP covariance matrix that arise from adding full training curves, the selection of the maximum number of augmented points (M=15) and the threshold for the natural log of the GP condition number (δ=20) are fixed, which might require tuning for different scenarios. The effectiveness relies on the assumption that learning progress can be meaningfully compressed into a single numeric score using a Sigmoid function, although the function parameters are learned from data, the functional form itself is pre-specified.",
    "Future Research Directions": "The authors suggest that the BOIL framework can be extended beyond machine learning to other iterative processes that could benefit from exploiting their iterative structure, such as the optimization of manufacturing pipelines where factory settings are adjusted to increase productivity. The work also contributes towards the broader goal of constructing automated pipelines for training and deploying machine learning models, implying further research into making these pipelines more robust and autonomous.",

    "Experiment Result": "Acquisition function settings: The method utilizes a modified Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, specifically 'ei_mu_max'. This variant uses the maximum of the GP's predictive mean as the incumbent value `y_max`. The acquisition function balances high function value, high uncertainty, and low cost using the formulation `log(utility) - log(mean_cost)` (for EI) or `log(1+np.exp(utility))/np.log(1+np.exp(mean_cost))` for other types, to compute the overall score for selecting the next point. The `utility_cost_evaluation` function within the BOIL class handles this balancing, minimizing the negative of this combined acquisition function. Acquisition function maximization is performed using a multi-start L-BFGS-B optimizer over the scaled search space."

Output:
{'novelty_reason': 'The proposal keeps the entire BOIL pipeline unchanged and only replaces the scalar that represents a partial learning curve with\n    u(x,t)=s(r(x,t);m0,g0)−β·log(1+C(x,t)).\nBOIL already (1) models training cost with a separate regressor, (2) incorporates that cost into its acquisition function and (3) learns a sigmoid-based utility from data. What BOIL never does is let the surrogate model see the actual cost when regressing the utility. Injecting a logarithmic cost penalty directly into the compression therefore removes BOIL’s implicit assumption that two runs with identical final accuracy but widely different runtimes are equally useful. While the idea of cost-aware HPO is well-known (Hyperband, cost-weighted EI, multi-fidelity BO, BOIL’s own acquisition), the concrete mechanism of folding cost into the learned curve-compression rather than the acquisition layer appears unpublished. Nevertheless, the change is conceptually simple (one extra term), deterministic, and does not require new theory, kernels, or acquisition functions. Hence the contribution is an incremental but still distinguishable design choice.', 'novelty_score': 5, 'significance_reason': 'From a practical standpoint, the modification yields 25 % higher AUC-time and 30–40 % faster arrival at peak performance on two benchmarks while keeping BOIL’s sample efficiency. Because it only changes one line of code, the method can be adopted in any existing BOIL implementation (and potentially in other curve-compression schemes) with negligible engineering overhead, directly translating into saved GPU hours―an asset for both academia and industry where compute is costly and capped. Academically, it empirically demonstrates that where the cost term is injected in a BO framework matters, providing evidence that surrogate-level cost information can outperform acquisition-level cost weighting alone. Still, the evaluation is limited to small-scale CNN and a single RL task, and the improvement magnitude, while useful, is not transformative. Consequently, the work is practically valuable but only moderately advances the theoretical state of the art.', 'significance_score': 6}
